83,this is a battery operated bug zapper that actually zaps bugs the only caveat is when you charge it from a wall outlet via the usb c cord that comes with it it charges up completely and works all night however the solar cell is not big enough or of the wrong configuration and it even on very sunny days will not charge up enough to give you more than 3 4 hours of zapping other than that a great bug zapper and no electric cord necessary which is great,['quality']
