Extra Virgin Olive Oil 1L DANTE Made in Italy,Cooking oil,The seller did not have Dante brand in stock. He offered me three alternative brands. I chose one of them. very responsive seller. The cap of the bottle I received was dented. seller kindly offered to return it if I was worried. but I took a chance and unscrewed the cap. There was a plastic stopper inside and it was well intact. only issue is that it is supposed to expire in another five months. Usually ones with long expiry dates are more expensive in the local market. Because of this short expiry the seller can offer it at Walmart price. Seller has covered the bottle with a lot of bubble wrap. Therefore the dent might have been there when it was packed. But still it is worth as I may use it soon. The seller is very responsive and responsible. Therefore him and the product are recommended. But suggest to be more careful during inspection before packing the item.,0,Wilson Michael,30,Female,Central
