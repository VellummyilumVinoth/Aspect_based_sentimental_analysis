we have 15 foot ceiling and its not easy to move tv and the cabinet tv sets on to be able to get ladder in place these last longer than other 9volt batteries we have tried in the past,-,poor,-,-,poor
ikd why the big box stores do not sell the 9v batteries in bulk so this is a great option  with three smoke detectors and my 2 dvms i use enough of these to warrant buying the bulk pack they are far superior to the ones sold in the dollar store type places,-,very good,-,very good,very good
i been using amazon basic batteries for years  they are just as good or better than the name brands at fraction of the cost got these 9 volts to replace all the fire detector batteries,very good,very good,very good,-,very good
"when my smoke alarm started to quack
i purchased this battery pack
replacing where needed
the warnings i heeded
so my fire safety wont lack

these batteries are a “10”
and i would buy them again
i wont soon run out
of that have no doubt
thats what im talking about",-,-,-,-,-
they worked only time will tell if the others will also work 23 years from now i bought bulk when i needed only 2 the price was irresistible,good,good,good,-,good
we use these mainly in our smoke detectors they last a few years and we havent had a dead one yet why pay more?,-,good,-,-,good
dont know who makes these but they last longer than any brand i have tried used for medical device i keep track of the hours of service my go to brand for batteries now thumbs upthumbs up,-,neutral,-,-,neutral
these seem to work ok i unfortunately tested them in two different expired carbon monoxide detectors i mistook the intermittent beeping as an indicator that the batteries were bad but it was actually the warning that it was time to replace the detectors lesson learned co detectors need to be replaced about every 7 years if yours is that old then it probably isnt the battery that needs replacing,-,bad,bad,-,bad
i live on the second floor and making sure my garbage gets to the dumpster in one complete bag is something i expect from my garbage bags but dont get often finally i found a bag that smells good and functions as expected will buy again,-,very good,-,-,very good

i was hesitant to purchase the lavender scent since its not my favorite but this scent is actually very nice the bags can handle heavy waste and tie nicely,-,-,-,-,-
these are a standby at my home they come in a way i particularly like in the box as wellthere are 4 rolled up sections so you only have to take one roll of bags out at a time letting you store the other rolls in your cleaning closet etc i much prefer this over pulling out one bag at a time they always seem to get messed up these are sturdy enough for all the trash we have in our home so there are no problems with seams opening etc a good value for the cost a good staple to have on hand,very good,very good,very good,very good,very good
as we all know the prices of some basic household items had skyrocketed very cheap trash bags that i tried didnt work well or tore as easily as tissue paper i though id give the amazon brand a try and im glad i did theyre an economical alternative to the very expensive brand name bags and are sturdy enough to hold quite a few items considering the price for the number of bags and the drawstring closure i will be buying these again as needed,very good,very good,-,-,very good
we used  to buy our unscented kitchen trash bags at target but all of a sudden they dont have any  were so happy to find these 120 unscented bags on amazon  they arrived in a mediumlarge box with the bag box inside it  there were four rolls of 30 bags each  i opened one bag to make sure it was really 13 gallon size and that it was unscented  only problem is you need to get rubber bands or zip lock bags to hold the rolls so they dont unravel  they are bare rolls with nothing holding them together  we couldnt fit them all in our kitchen drawer so put rubber bands around each roll and stored some in the pantry  they should last us several years,-,very good,-,very good,very good
if your anything like me your waiting last minute until you have no trash bags left and trying to balance your daily life and not sure when you will actually have time to go get a new box wellllll im here to tell you that this box of trash bags last soooo long they lasted so long that i ended up doing subscribe and save because i was so impressed i literally never run out and when a new box comes in the mail i still have some left from the previous order they work they wont break they do the job,-,very good,very good,very good,very good

these are slightly thinner than comparable brand name bags but thats to be expected from any house brand product havent had any issues with tearing or failure which is the important thing would buy again if i couldnt find the brand names on sale,-,poor,-,-,poor

these are standard paper towels that do its job as expected good value for the amount of paper towels you get the rolls allow for half and full sheets they dont tear away easily as each time i take one it tears from itself or the following sheet,good,good,good,-,good
my daughter in law joked that she wanted a year long  supply of paper towels and toilet paper for christmas so i put this on a monthly subscription for her  she said its the best gift shes ever gotten haha,-,very good,-,-,very good
"i recently purchased the amazon basics 2ply paper towels flexsheets 6 rolls and i must say i was pleasantly surprised i was initially worried that the material would be too hard and not very soft but i was pleasantly surprised to find that it was actually quite absorbent and easily tears nicely

the rolls are of a good quantity so you have a good amount of towels to get through they are quite thick and feel a lot more sturdy than some of the other paper towels i have used in the past they have a nice texture and feel to them so they dont feel too rough or flimsy when youre using them

i have found that these paper towels are very absorbent and pick up any spills with ease they are also easy to tear and dont break apart when youre trying to tear off a sheet ive also found that they dont leave any residue behind and they dont leave any lint on surfaces or your hands

the only downside i can think of is that they are a bit hard not as soft as some of the other paper towels on the market but overall i think they are a great product and i would highly recommend them to anyone looking for a reliable and absorbent paper towel",-,very good,-,-,very good
these paper towel are decent not your thickest but also not the thinnest the main thing about these paper towels is when you tear off half sheet it does not tear off cleanly it may take some time to learn how to tear cleanly with these compare to the good brands that just tear with no special pull other than that they will dry your hands with half sheet not bad for price once you learn how to tear,very good,very good,very good,-,very good
these are a steal the product is good quality and the shipping was fast i didnt want to spend a ton of money for something i wipe my hands on and amazon brand consistently offers great deals on name brand stuff,very good,very good,very good,-,very good
we made the switch as these are cheaper than other brands however the absorbency is not quite comparable the sheets are more thin than bounty and the rolls are a bit smaller overall it still made sense to switch with the price difference and i would say on average they are about the same as some of the leading brands,neutral,-,-,-,neutral
i have this on auto ship and im on my third case now i like the select a size but in this case of towels the perforation isnt complete and the towels dont tear apart easily or evenly for that matter these arent as absorbent nor as soft as the pricier bounty brand but they are cheaper so youre getting what youre paying for im on my fifth roll of my most recent case and all five have had the perforation issue it defeats the purpose of select a size i may move to plan b for my next selection of paper towels,poor,-,-,-,poor
quality is adequate but due to thinness every tear leaves part on next sheet,-,neutral,-,-,neutral
i have been a faithful user of a different brand of toilet paper for decades yes i will admit i am a tp snob my family and friends all know my preference of tp and when i go to their houses for visits i always ask when are they gonna get the “good” toilet paper? i wasnt above taking my own tp when i went for visits well when the pandemic started and toilet paper became harder to find than a hens tooth i ordered as much of whatever tp i could get and was glad to have it that is when i discovered cottonelle oh my goodness why had i been wasting all those years on the “other” brand that i thought should be the only  toilet paper in the world when i could have been using cottonelle? i did eventually had orders of that other brand delivered but honestly they are in my storage closet just in case of an emergency i fell in love with the texture of cottonelle it doesnt “shed” little fuzzy lint all over my bathroom and me like the “other” brand did i have found that cottonelle is stronger yet still very soft and i feel much much cleaner using it than i ever did with my old brand so yes i am still a tp snob except i have changed brands never ever in a million years saw that coming but it did so i totally 100 recommend cottonelle thank you for reading my review and i hope that i may have encouraged you to give cottonelle a try and see the difference for yourself take care,-,very good,-,very good,very good
ok  its only toilet paper but like to know what im getting and with cottonellle  im good  always my first choice and will go looking for it if i need to re supply,-,very good,-,-,very good
we all need it its tp toilet paper awipe its soft absorbent doesnt have perfumes or dyes doesnt leave lint on your bum  it will clog your pipes if you dont watch the little ones and they put too much in the potty it makes a great gift for when there is a death and lots of epe go visit someone no one wants to think about needing to go buy extra tp send a case of this cottonelle ultra comfort toilet paper it will lighten the mood and people will laugh and talk kindly about you i highly recommend this tp buy some today,-,-,-,-,-

ordered these batteries as i have in the past i usually get one large box as described in the ad and photo i received three “not for resale” old boxes that were opened and spilled out in the envelope and then a fourth random 8 pack from singapore batteries appear old and im not sure what happened in this one but i will be returning these as i dont feel confident using them in any of my devices safely,-,-,-,neutral,neutral
so i normally get the duracell batteries but i saw these in my amazon shopping feed and i decided to give them a try i was shellshocked because everything i put them in needed another battery within two weeks usually i can put in a duracell battery and i wont have to even think about it for quite some time so i dont know how they got all these good reviews and less i got a bad batch? which i feel highly unlikely,-,neutral,neutral,-,neutral
product arrived in two different packages  one had three packages inside non were torn but the outside package was flimsy and had fallen apart  the other package was a single pack of 8 batteries  it was open but all 8 batteries were included  appeared that product had been in high humidity storage  does not appear to have any damage to any batteries but wonder if they will perform as well after the storage method seems doubtful,-,-,-,bad,bad

got these awhile back and waited to do the review to see how long they would last my household lol with kids toys and tv remotes and such that use batteries like crazy i didnt have high hopes for this package lasting longbut boy was i wrong i still have over half a package left these suckers last a long time you play a game of chance getting them from the stores cause you have no clue how long they have been sitting on kiosks or in the back of the store but theseits like they came straight from the factory fully loaded they have yet to die out im kinda happy about it but kinda unnerved about it as wellcause now i have to hear the noise making toys all day every day lol what have i done by buying these things??,-,very good,very good,very good,very good

this may not mean a lot to many people but it does apply to me i have a paper towel holder and ive noticed that the majority of the paper towels the brown roller device that holds the paper towels together is always a little bit too small and so when i put it on the paper towel holder it barely fits and its ridiculous to try and get paper towels off but for some reason on this particular brand they make the roller bigger so the paper towels spins off the holder so much easier the paper towel themselves are similar to other brands they work as desired but because of the bigger circumference of the cardboard holder inside the paper towels and how easily they spin on the paper towel holder  these are the paper towels i will be buying from now on,-,very good,-,-,very good
consistent quality bought at 26 off sale 90 cents per 100 sheets saves a fortune by not using strong premium priced towels for 90 percent of your spills and pickups also gives size option with tear sheets,poor,poor,-,-,poor
great price especially for an area that needs to be treated with love and comfort last thing you need to do next is a review for hemorrhoid medicine go 2 ply its the best ply,very good,very good,-,-,very good
this towel is noticeable lighter and thinner than a bounty towel of the same size but im my opinion bounty thickness is overkill for most of the quick things i use them for  so this lesser towel is still suitable for my needs and comes in at a lower price  if i have a heavy task i just double up  and these tear like a dream so i can do the one hand yank without making a mess thats what she said and yank one off the towel holder without both hands usually required for bounty or both hands and your foot required for brawny  my advice try them for yourself and decide  maybe you will take your business away from bounty who has lost their mind on pricing,very good,very good,-,-,very good

this is the best toilet paper in existence and the only acceptable one for our household according to my wife im not too picky about toilet paper though some certainly qualify as substandard but my wife has requirements and standards lucky for me shes not that picky about husbands ive bought regular old store brands and suffered for it i wanted to try some neat ecofriendly bamboo tushy tissue and she gave it a shot but declared it didnt make the cut i stock any old thing in the kids bathroom but under her throne its charmin for her or the dog house for me,-,very good,-,-,very good

i was skeptical about these scrubbies being worth the price but thanks to amazons liberal return policy and the great reviews i suspended disbelief and bought them so far they are outperforming expectations they are unbelievably durable  you cant believe the crud they cut through and then rinse so clean they look brand new as advertised they dont smell probably because they are nonabsorbent and have an open honeycomblike structure i love that there are different colors in each set so i can keep track of which ones i use for what purpose so i dont scrub vegetables with the one i use to clean the bathroom — they hold up so well id  be hardpressed to tell them apart otherwise from how theyre holding up so far i dont doubt another reviewer that the answer is months and months they dont shed nasty little particles of themselves like cheapo scrubbers they dont fall apart they dont stain or lose their shape at the end of the day they pay for themselves in very short order the one thing id change is that instead of smiley faces id like little finger holes for easier gripping because i have small hands otherwise im about to buy the squareshaped scrub daddies that will reach into corners better bottom line these are one of my best purchases so far this year,very good,very good,-,-,very good
i first ordered scrub daddy and scrub mommy from qvc i was completely impressed most sponges are simply gross after you use them one or two times i had gotten in the habit of buying them from the dollar store and just throwing them out every week but what a waste scrub daddy is fantastic and very long lasting they rarely get food stains on them and if they do you can put them in the dishwasher never had a sponge you could do this with they come out clean and sanitized i also love the scrub mommy but i am moving out of a place ive lived 10 years and i need scrubbing power highly recommend these,-,very good,very good,-,very good
you have to get these thoroughly soaking wet to make them pliable  especially with the use a powdered nonabrasive cleaner they are awesome for results on pots and pans  do not use them on plastic such as the bowl of a food processor  i found out the hard way that they will scratch plastic  but for pots and pans unparalleled cleaning and they dont scratch stainless or nonstick pans,-,good,-,-,good
i absolutely love my scrub daddy they are very well thought out and its a no brainer it was on shark tank and got an offer better than a standard sponge/scotchbrite combo any day of the week need to scrub something that would normally require a scotch brite? all you need to do is grab your scrub daddy add some soap and use cool water and it stays stiff to allow for really easy scrubbing if you want it softer you add warm water and it becomes soft and pliable best thing is that it never starts to smell i have used mine for months without it ever starting to stink it also does not scratch or damage pans i have used it to clean just about every type of pan with every type of coating and no issues the mouth can be used to scrub cooking spoons and the eyes are good for reusable straws and chopsticks and everything in between i literally tell everyone to buy scrub daddys i have literally converted everyone i know and they are not going back they eventually start to wear out and i have even extended the life of it by just using some scissors to snip off the bits that start to fray around the edges highly recommend the three pack too cheaper per sponge than the individual ones,very good,very good,-,-,very good
these got rid of the smell you would get with normal sponges but mine are starting to stretch out by the lower mouth area and now the ‘mouth is so stretched out my hand slides through it when trying to use it its annoying and difficult to clean dishes when your hand slides though the hole,-,good,-,-,good
its exactly what it is my current location sells individual scrub daddys for 4 dollars and this was an absolute steal scrub daddy has never been a fault and ive personally really enjoyed them i use them at work and at home although they dont last as much as id like to at work in a restaurant it works for long periods of time at home totally recommend if the price is better here like it is for me,very good,very good,very good,-,very good
holy moly i finally got some of these and used one on my glass cooktop stove i used only the sponge and almost all of the burnt on stuff came off im excited to see if i can get the rest of the stuff off if i use the sponge with a cleaning paste definitely worth the money,very good,very good,-,-,very good
best sponge ever  no scent after leaving it on the sink  works great with the paste to clean dirty surfaces and black off the bottom of pans if you have someone that messes up your pots and pans like i do face with tears of joy,-,very good,-,-,very good
i needed a 13 gal liner that was water proof  i tried all the junk at the big box stores and they all failed  being a prime member i thought if these dont work as advertised back they go  but to date not one has failed  i use these along with pine pellets to absorb any liquid from a kitchen or bath you can image  the pine pellets retain the liquids but stuff may pool up at the bottom of the bag when over saturated  with the other bags stuff has wept through the bag leaving an almost condensation like to small puddle in the bottom of the bucket  and with these bags absolutely dry  no need to clean the 5 gal pail after every use  to date ive gone through about 10 bags without fail  one bag in particular you could see the liquid at the bottom 1/3 of the bag  yuk  but zero leakage  none  i didnt take pictures because you can let your imagination run wild with the grossness  but so far these bags are great  if anything significant changes ill do an update to this review  i should mention too with the big box store bags and big brand name bags their leakage was at least 50 very aggravating  thats why im writing this review  so far these bags are great if youre into this sort of thing  great job amazon  hope this helps  mike,-,very good,-,very good,very good

"im going to start by saying this mop is amazing the price is decent the size of the bucket is just right too much mop water wastes and heavy to carry around too little doesnt hold enough dirt in solution  the pedalactivated spinning centrifuge to drain the water is so simple its genius for the most part this mop is goat in my book ive used a ton of other mops including the cheap ten dollar kind where you have to twist the ratcheting handle to squeeze the water out this beats all of them hands down

it does have a few small problems though and they should be easy for ocedar to fix
1 the bucket has an imprint inside it to show you the quantity of water in liters including the max fill line this imprint was done so shallow theyre nearly impossible to see these should stick out more and ideally be painted white over the letters if they were only sticking out more that would be fine someone could easily use a paint marker to highlight these but currently we cant
2 the distance between the outer perimeter of the centrifuge and the sides of the bucket is somewhat small its very easy to go past the centrifuge with the mop head and just drip mop water all over the sides especially on top of the pedal which then makes the pedal slippery they could add a small wall around the perimeter of the centrifuge maybe an inch high to solve this
3 the mop head doesnt have enough strands and theyre not balanced well enough if youre on tacky surfaces or pushing your mop away from your body its very easy for the strands to get caught on the surface and the edge of the mop head the red triangle makes contact with the surface you can damage hardwood floors accidentally the mop head needs to be more dense
4 a clip or some kind of holder on the bucket to hold the mop when not in use would have been great as well

other than these few problems the mop has a lot of other things going well for it in addition to everything i already mentioned
1 the ergonomics are great theres a little handle under the pedal you can grasp to tilt the bucket to empty it out the bucket holds well in the hand too
2 the mop wand is decent the collapsing design is great for storage after use its a little tough to twist to collapse but it works havent noticed any weakness in it it does creak but its made of plastic never snapped on me and doesnt seem like it ever will
3 the pedalactivated wringing out is more accessible for older and disabled people because it requires lower leg strength other mops require upper arm strength to wring out the mop people usually have worse dexterity in their hands and arms than they do their legs since we walk on our legs and stand upright against gravity constantly even people who dont regularly exercise will find this easier to use
4 it makes mopping fun and convenient which makes people mop more than they normally would this is always a good thing
5 when youre done rinse the mop head out let it dry then stow your mop and whatever bottle of mopping solution in the bucket itself to save space
6 the gears and mechanism for the pedalactivated centrifuge are clearly visible and appear to be easily removable with a few screws yes theyre plastic which sucks because the durability is low but it also means theyre probably cheap to replace if you strip or wear them out you can probably even 3d print replacement gears if you have a 3d printer

all in all this is an excellent mop for everyone yourself for older or disabled people kids on chore duty great for people who live in small apartments its a total win in my book

here are some tips
1 when using the pedal keep your foot in contact with the pedal at all times do not push it down than raise your foot faster than the pedal comes up without anything on top the pedal comes up too fast and grinds the plastic gears not a good sound and theyll strip eventually
2 i find mopping side to side with the tip of the mop head pointing forward works better than moving the mop forward or backward but this is just good mopping technique in general
3 plan how youre going to mop i like to decide where im going to stop mopping in my apartment then work furthest from that area backwards to where i want to stop this way i minimize walking on any freshly mopped surface
4 if youre working on a tacky/sticky surface the mop strands will grab more due to the increased friction this will unbalance the mop head and youll start to strike the surface with the plastic on the mop head to allow the mop head to glide smoothly increase the amount of mopping solution in the head dont spin as much out for these areas
5 let the mop head do the work dont push down on the mop head let it glide over the surface and put your effort in moving the mop head side to side",very good,very good,very good,very good,very good
"easy to use mop head wrings out wonderfully  this system works  several years ago i purchased a different brand and had difficulty with keeping the mop head attached  i gave this one a complete work out  i have a 600 sq ft plywood floor painted with porch and floor paint i vacumed moved every piece of movable furniture and mopped with a lot of pressure changed out the water 5 times  the floor has the original shine that porch and floor paint gives  every water change out i also rinsed out the mop head in the laundry sink it cleans out easily  on this floor i had frequently used the quickie clean up with swifter and or other floor cleaning products  for this i used just hot water and watched the bucket water foam up with the residue from the floor  every once in a while you got to just go for clean and start over  this is the way to go i am 75 and used to be able to get down on my hands and knees and scrub the floor last year that changed  this mop system gave me that kind of clean back  thanks

update my original order included a second mop head for my car  this mops triangular shape and low flat tilt allows me to go underneath the rack on my rig which allows me to run it back and forth just as if i were working the floor i am 5 short  i used cold water and scrubbed everything down  i did not clean wheel wells out or running boards that have heavy dirt in between or just before car wash times this again is perfect easy to use easy to clean  the flat tilt goes under my fridge and freezer",-,very good,very good,-,very good
i got the basic model as im moving into an apartment and will be basically only mopping my bath and kitchen the upgraded version separates dirty water from the clean which is brilliant and is easier to fill with water that being said the basic mop works great for me as i mop weekly and my floors never get that dirty the microfiber mop doesnt leave streaks and the design allows me to get into corners my mopping also goes quicker with this system and its easier on arthritic hands than the old squeeze mop i had i find that my floors also dry quicker the addition of wheels would be great so i didnt have to carry the bucket from room to room but its not a deal breaker overall i love this spin mop and ive tried them all,-,very good,very good,very good,very good
i saw a lady on tik tok clean her blinds with this mop so i put it in my cart  my loving husband saw the mop sitting in my cart and bought it for me  he said he knew it wasnt that romantic but he wanted me to have it if i wanted  he was buying a weeder to pull up dandelions so he bought me a mop to be fair  that is real love  so anyway i got the mop and i immediately mixed water and vinegar and cleaned my blinds  then my 7 year old daughter mopped the kitchen  she loves it because she can wrong the mop by herself  if you have a little one that you want to get involved in chores this is a great mop for kids too  i truly recommend it,-,very good,-,-,very good
ive tried traditional mop and bucket swiffers mops with changeable microfiber pads steam mop and more  but every one of those options has something about them that i didnt like  the main things i want are to be able to use hot water my own brand of cleaner and not get my hands wet  the ocedar provides all that and the bonus of a changeable mop head so you can wash them microfiber and the ability to wring out the water so that your mop is actually damp and not dripping wet  mopping is now something i can do quickly and easily  i love it  my only complaint would be that the mop heads could be larger and more dense,-,very good,-,-,very good
i love this mop im one of those people who love to clean so i was really excited to try this “viral” mop usually i just use a very standard mop with a spray function it was a little weird getting used to having a bucket with the mop but i really liked it it worked really well yes all mops can clean the floor but it felt really easy with this one i also enjoyed stepping on the peddle and spinning it i know that sounds weird but it was just cool overall if you need a new mop this one is definitely worth it its a little awkward to store but its easy and fast to use,-,very good,-,-,very good

the only problem i have had with using these bags is the drawstrings often break when closing the bags i twist the top of the bag and then tie the drawstring around it not a big deal and easy to work around definitely better than a weak bag with sturdy drawstrings

"i had a new keyfob remote programmed for my vehicle since the car i bought didnt come with a second fob  the new fob wasnt starting the car correctly half the time unless i pressed it up against the engine start button  i was advised it could be a bad battery  i bought this 4 pack from amazon because i refused to pay more at a local store  this battery seems to have fixed the starting problem  now i have some spares and ill likely need one soon for when the original remotes battery runs low

i could not provide a longevity rating as i have only been using the battery for a couple of days  seeing as these are budget batteries i wouldnt expect them to last as long as namebrand competitors  the price is great though  i dont mind if i have to replace these twice as often

im not sure why distributers sell keyfobs with old batteries  i would think they should supply a brand new battery with each remote that goes out  they ought to know they cant let fobs sit on shelves for months if not years with a battery installed in them as thats going to drain it over time  i suppose they dont care and want us to deal with this hassle instead  endofrant

the bad its not the product itself its the packaging grab your scissors and be ready to fight for your right to get to your product just be careful not to get nicked in the process the clamshell is hard tight and pretty unforgiving a feature which might be great for anti theft protection but seeing as this is probably primarily sold online hopefully it becomes more user friendly in the future

we purchase these garbage bags for our kitchen garbage we have an unusual shape kitchen garbage most people have a 13gal garbage but would want white or something less lawn bag looking but ours matches the can itself and no one sees it because of where it is located in our kitchen the bags come 80 to a box which is a great and the price is the best around the aroma is lovely and for some reason our cat hates it so she no longer sits on top of our pail and knocks it over when she jumps off probably smells too pretty and she likes fishy smells the mil is 09 but dont let that number fool you if you put it up against a 1 mil bag it would hold up just as well and believe me i know i stick cans with sharp edges and other things because we dont have the proper recycling program so they just burn our trash and nothing cuts through while if you were holding the two together this one would of course feel thinner it still would have the staying power in the past i have used these for the first of the season yard clean up fall leaves and even grass collection i cant say enough about how well they hold up we store stuff in them  donate items in them and when we make up sleeping bags coats socks and toiletries for the homeless this is what we use because its great for them to reuse if needed so you can say this is very versatile i would and have give my family and friends this as a great bag if needed and i know at least 3 of my family members so far have switched and also are buying on amazon saying it is truly the best price make sure to always compare though they can change at any time,very good,very good,very good,very good,very good

"we have a fleas problem at home we started to apply diatomaceous earth powder and boric acid to our carpet area since beginning of september and right now the problem seems to be under control we rarely get stung by fleas now diatomaceous earth works great in killing fleas i found death fleas from both the carpet area and tiles area where we left diatomaceous earth

 because of the mechanical nature of the killing action there are only a certain number of fleas that it can kill in a day if the fleas infestation is so bad that more adult fleas pop up than what de in our home can kill daily our fleas problem will get worse instead of getting better de and boric acid as well should be used to contain small to medium size fleas infestation in a truly massive outbreak daily vacuuming to remove as many fleas larvae and eggs as possible is going to be more helpful than de until the fleas population is under control since we have a dust separator and it deposit the dust into a bucket i verified that de kill fleas of all size in both tiles and carpet area i was mighty please that i found 7 dead fleas when i vacuum out the de in the master bathroom a room that i thought was clear of fleas how wrong can i get?

 the best recommendation for de usage i read involve 1 apply de on carpet and then vacuum out de from the carpet 12 to 48 hours after the initial application for tiles surface just spread de on it and vacuum it out with the same schedule as carpet area  2 then vacuum the house daily 3 apply de again 7 days after the initial application repeat the cycle 45 times in our case since we dont see adult fleas much but still a lot baby fleas we modify the plan and left de in the carpet boric acid was vacuumed out a few days after application until an area with active baby fleas population my feet will tell me where the active baby fleas are if i feel active baby fleas in the carpet i would vacuum out the de and go through vacuum twice a day routine on the infested area for 23 days and then apply the de again my hope is that the vacuuming will control the infestation to the point that de in my carpet can kill the new fleas fast enough and we will left the de in the carpet for the next 69 months at least so far the plan seems to work well we are in day 17 now i only vacuum selected part of the house every day and the fleas is still under control

maintaining a thin layer of de on tile surface is not an easy task in a busy room like the kitchen where a lot of people walking in and out de tends to get pushed to the grout line and stay there by the end of the day we are back to smooth tiles surface with most if not all the de are in the grout line our solution is to swipe up all the de with broom and pan and reapply de at night the average time it take de to kill a fleas is between 46 hours so  for the ‘de on tile surface plan to work we need to find a window of 810 hours that the kitchen is off limit to everyone  after we reapply the de daily

for the garage area we wash the floor with 51 diluted bleach solution weekly since de in the garage is a no go i am concern that the filter in my car will get destroyed if it suck up some de on the garage floor

we also bought some victor fleas trapm230a 8 of them and deployed the traps to each room  we started with 3 and like it so much that we get the rest and put them to use in different parts of our house and it is very helpful to have the fleas trap as our last line of defense we caught a few fleas in rooms that we thought is clear with the de the operating cost of these trap are very low about 10 cents a day including the cost of burned light bulb and electricity for easing our mind these fleas trap is a great investment

steam cleaner the one with steam over 220 f can be helpful to kill fleas in small area or furnitures i used to have a mccullogh mc1375 for a while and in the process of switching to a dupray neat steam advertised to deliver 275f steam it will be very useful to clear the stubborn small fleas infested carpet area chair sofa bed with steam cleaner much faster than de or salt/baking soda but more labor intensive so steam cleaning only work for small area

since fleas operates 24x7 in reproducing and biting us we can never hope to out work them the best hope i think is to make our home so hostile to the entire cycle of the fleas life to get rid of them boric acid de and heated fleas trap all work 24x7 and hopefully we can defect these pest with these tools over time after the past 17 days our tiles area are reasonably clear of fleas activities de is on the tile throughout some carpet area still have baby fleas activities and i am vacuuming those area daily garage seem to be clear of fleas at this point cars still need work

de is very messy to handle and easily blow out my home vacuum cleaner  we use a shop vac to vacuum out the de when needed rigid  65 hp sold in homedepot and a dust separator also sold in hd once i vacuum out the de and boric acid from the carpet i start to use my dyson v11 for the daily vacuuming  and the filter in dyson v11 has to be cleaned using the blowing function of the rigid shop vac 78 times already the shop vac pick up most of the de de buried deep in the carpet will cause problem for our v11 and 3 new v11 filter in the last 17 days i cant imagine a way to handle de without a shop vac and constantly cleaning filter

ps update this review on 9/27/20 about 3 weeks after initial application of de we still have a couple areas in our home a small carpet area in dinning room and a small carpet area in family room that still have some fleas activities de kill fleas slowly take average 46 hours  and it seem to be more effective in killing larger flea than small one that mean i notice some stinking bite from the small male fleas occasionally from those small infested  area for now i just try to avoid these area and wait until the de kill the small male fleas since we applied de and boric acid in our house starting 9/3/20 we saw progressively less fleas activities in our house i am hopeful that we will ultimately clear these 2 small area and our car  of fleas   i cleaned the filter in the shop vac for the first time a couple days ago and it is ugly de and boric acid stuck in the filter and i have to wash the shop vac filter  be prepare to do a lot of filter cleaning on both your regular vacuum and shop vac when you use de one thing i really like about de is that we have not sprayed any insecticide in our home since 9/3 and still have the fleas under control not eliminated yet victor fleas trap is my last defense in car de fail to kill some fleas i am hopeful that we can eliminate fleas in another 46 weeks

pps update 10/4/20 as it turns out de is very good in killing the female fleas which is bigger in size but it is much slower in killing the smaller male fleas we had 4 small area in our house and my car  around 3x5 ft or so on an average still have fleas  i noticed that i will get bitten once in a while if i stay in these in these small infested area obviously the most important one to kill are the female fleas since it break the cycle of more fleas but these small male fleas can live a lot longer than the 4 to 6 hours average so i vacuumed out the de and applied 50/50 very fine salt pop corn salt prepared by using food processor and regular salt to those area and let it stay in the carpet for 2 days and it seem to help 3 out of the 4 area  as of now i have de on all the carpet and just waiting for it to kill the rest of the fleas may be another couple weeks? in the tiles area keeping a layer of de in our busy kitchen is an impossible task so i just vacuumed the til floo o remove those fleas

given our experience so far if we were to have fleas again i would 1 apply a combination of boric acid/fine salt/baking soda for the carpet area and mop the tiles floor with bleach daily for busy area and use de for less traffic tiles area to start 2 let the mixture stay in the carpet 23 days and then vacuum them out and apply de to the carpet area and less used tiles area use lighted fleas trap as on those infested area as a safe guard 3  vacuum busy tiles area with any sign of fleas and for the carpet steam cleaning the area with fleas activities no need to vacuum out the de de will still work after it dried with a qualified steamer can clear a small area of fleas much faster than waiting for de magic to work an hour or less work for small area compare to waiting for a few weeks  this approach should clear the fleas problem a lot faster than the 46 weeks or longer needed by using de exclusively

de is excellent as a watch guard waiting for adult fleas to emerge but the killing action take a lot of waiting time for the fleas to go from egg> larvae> pupae > adult and it take even longer for the really small male fleas it is best to avoid those area with fleas activity even the area is covered by de already since it take a while to kill the male fleas it make no sense to let those fleas bit us if we can help it my wife has a rain boot on walking around the house and it help her avoid getting bitten  i hope my experience is helpful for other who has fleas i  learn a lot and i am convinced that a lot of online article about fleas were written by authors who have never had a fleas problem some of the advise i read were ridiculous and impractical now that i have experienced the problem first hand steam cleaner essential oil fleas light boric acid etc all can help but de seems to be the one that can finish the job to clean up a fleas problem at least i am hopeful

ppps update 10/10/20 finally give up on the idea of using de have a talk with an extended family member who had a fleas problem resolved and an exterminator and come to the realization the importance of very frequent vacuuming de is a mean to eliminate adult fleas in the house but in order to eradicate the problem we need to control  the egg larvae and pupa stage as well vacuuming is the tool that can eliminate fleas in all these stage so vacuuming is the star while de and a lot of other approach are supporting characters i think i loss sight of the important distinction in our particular situation the carpet area is about 16001700 sq ft it took me 2 hour to vacuum up de that covered abut 800 sq ft yesterday with frequent vacuuming that mean i need to vacuum and then replace the de every week for 48 weeks using the shop vac for 5 hours every week is too taxing for me i am 60 now that is why i tried to use the lazy approach and only vacuum up de in area with more fleas activities my approach miss the point that frequent vacuuming is the single most beneficial fleas control tool with professional exterminator they will spray insecticideigr and then we vacuum for 12 weeks and reapply if necessary vacuuming everyday using a dyson is within my physical ability this is the finer point that no one mentioned de is extremely messy and physically demanding to vacuum up

i use a shop vac with a dust separator and my shop vacs filter was still mess up and loss suction quite rapidly a lengthy cleaning bring back the filter back but it is more work that no one mentioned for anyone who consider using de the daily workload is something to be considered for now i am vacuuming out all my de and will vacuum our carpet area like crazy i ordered pt ultracide and apply them when it get here hopefully it will help us eliminate our fleas problem our house has never has a major infestation just minor fleas activities non stop in various part of the house that drive us nut the small fleas that wont bite us but  crawl all over our legs and now getting on our beds and body de is doing very well in killing those larger female fleas and eventually those smaller males adult fleas but the saga wont end we are basically at a standstill 5 weeks into our fleas journey and we are at the same spot as when we began in early september no major infestation but problem in different small area eg 3x5 ft around the house  i am hoping the much more aggressive vacuuming and igr will help us eliminate our flea problem in a few weeks instead of back to the same spot again good luck to everyone who has a fleas problem and decide to pursue with de and vacuuming

pppps we have our house sprayed on 10/15/20 by an exterminator after talking to the exterminator i realize that they know about fleas and the chemical that can kill them effectively much more than i do our exterminator use a combination of 3 insecticide 1 for fast knock out with no residual one kill adult fleas in 34 hours with 90 days residual and finally one with combined insecticide and igr this is the first time i heard about residual and the importance of residual killing of fleas in eradication residual simply means how long can the insecticide keep killing fleas after the spray de has infinite residual if we keep them in the carpet but 0 residual effect once we remove it the delima of using de is that we cannot vacuum out the fleas egg larvae or adult fleas when de is in the carpet so the ideal is to put de down for a day or 2 max and vacuum it out but the work involved in vacuuming out de is very messy and physically demanding because the shop vac are not designed to vacuum carpet once the size of the carpet area is > 1000 sq ft to handle in one afternoon so there is a work load issue for using de in handling fleas another issue we run into is both our cars and house has fleas and we bring the fleas back and forth using insecticide with long residual help us resolve both problems at the same time without worrying about reintroduction of fleas into the house or car since they will be kill within a few hours once they get drop onto the carpet treated with long residual insecticide this is a concept that i dont understand and de has problem with once the de is out of the carpet new fleas introduced into the environment will be free to roam and lay eggs until the next scheduled de round i think that is one major reason some users reported that they cannot resolve their fleas issue with de insecticide with long residual will help enormously

with what i went through since beginning of sept my 2 cents is that professional exterminator is really the best bet de will do what it advertised but as an individual we lack the experience to deal with fleas and use de correctly in the best case de can be used to help take care of small to medium size infestation my guess carpet area less than 800100 sq ft once over this size chemical is the solution if only because of the workload issue a good exterminator is worth their weight in gold when i called around there are exterminator who want the job with no guarantee or follow up why would anyone hire them? our exterminator did the initial spray on the carpet and sideboard on all the tiles area nothing on the tile will come back in one week to do a second spray on the carpet area only with the fast knock out and long residual insecticide and set up glue board and he will check back on the third week i wish individual can share their experience in more details and it will help future users decide if de will help them cost wise de are pretty expensive to use if you need to get the shop vac etc our exterminator cost use 350 in northern california and de probably cost us about the same up to this point multiple new dyson filters that it kills new shop vac new dust separator heated fleas trap is a good item to get and it help tremendously steamer help on spot cleaning dont know about whether boric acid is effective or not since i cannot determine whether larvae get killed or not fine salt and baking soda work somewhat and it depends if you can apply them on the fleas or not at the end it is important to note that the soonest de can eliminate all the fleas take 46 weeks but chemical insecticideigr can deal with fleas in 23 weeks times is important discussion since fleas will keep reproducing if we give them the chance i think i come to conclusion that chemical is the better solution",very good,very good,very good,very good,very good
"we had a major ant problem in and around our house and i sprayed this powder around the edges on the outside of the house and behind cabinets and along baseboards etc inside in order to help repel and kill the ants

we had such a large ghost ant  population around here that i had to use various efforts to discourage them from coming in the house

i used this and boric acid at the same time because i just wanted to make sure that something would work i also sprayed all around the house and put ant stakes inside and outside but i know this works because there have been times that i used it with nothing else

the problem with all these antiant substances or methods is that what often happens is the ants die in transit

so i began to find dead ants here and there and everywhere they often die before they get back to their nest and in fact they die sometimes on their way into the house after crossing over the path of the boric acid or diatomaceous earth or poison

so ive been finding dead ants here and there around my house for over a month now and i keep hoping they will leave me alone but they seem intent on wanting to live in and around my house even though i dont leave out food or anything

by the way i was told these are called ghost ants they seem to be everywhere in the area of central florida i was living in

one warning is to be very careful not to breathe diatomaceous earth it can actually cause damage to your lungs if you breathe too much of it i see many people using it carelessly be careful

for example when you open the bag the powder begins to sift into the air immediately which reaches your lungs so i advise wearing a good mask such as an n95 when messing with this stuff it is almost impossible to use it in any way without it getting into your air space so you have to be careful

people seem to think because you can actually mix this with water and drink it if it is the right type that it is not dangerous no it is not dangerous to drink it in water but it is dangerous to breathe it in its normal dry form

i also use this as a gnat killer by spraying it on top of the soil of my potted plants this seems to be working well

diatomaceous earth has many uses so i recommend you read about it but use it responsibly

i gave it only four stars because the sprayer that they give you with it doesnt really work very well at times it doesnt spray out at all and other times it sprays too much it is very difficult to control the sprayer ive seen other sprayers of this type that work better",-,bad,bad,-,bad

amazon there are so so many things i love about you all but what is up with the packaging on these batteries? i pulled out this beautiful box that could easily be re used as a gift box the packaging is 10 times the actual size of the batteries and such a waste of unrenewable resources i can hardly imagine packaging the batteries this elegantly is costeffective with all due respect amazon please do better for the earth,very good,very good,very good,very good,very good

i chose these batteries for replacements in a panasonic cordless phone set  our set is model number kxtg7871  the model number can be found on the main base station  the mah rating on these batteries is actually 800 mah and the original panasonic batteries is only 400 mah but that caused no problem at all  i cant speak to how long they will last because i just installed them in one of the handsets that we use the most  that handset gave me a message that indicated that the batteries were bad i dont remember the exact message  with this package i will have enough to replace all the handset batteries as they fail over time,-,bad,bad,bad,bad

short version if you get a couple of duds try putting them in a charger that can test or cycle them a few times until they come to a full charge  if your charger has that capability

would i recommend these? yes if and only if youre not using them in a expensive device otherwise? no recommend taking a look at them first prior to putting them into any device leakage can cause damage to small devices devices like remotes cordless mice flashlights should not be exposed right away so try it with something that is inexpensive or charge them first even testing the charge with a multi meter may help the few i had also showed up a little dry on the charge so they were in need of a recharge put them on the charger provided with the battery and that one of the twelve ive received leaked",good,good,-,-,good

i really like the idea of not having use a conventional mop no bucket not wringing the mop and no smelly mop to dry and eventually replace what is bothering about this product is the swivel feature of the head i know that it allows the user to maneuver around tight corners especially in the bathroom but every time that i try to just move the mop back and forth the head flips up and i have to reposition it to continue cleaning this repetitive motion results in pain in both my wrist and lower back thinking that adding more moisture to the pad would make the motion smoother did not improve the cleaning process im starting to regret not purchasing the wet jet,-,bad,bad,-,bad

"i purchased several different products and will share my feedback of each here for those who are comparison shopping i have always been a pet owner but recently adopted a terrier white hair short wiry sticks to everything i have never had as much trouble with pet hair as i do now i needed major help removing the hair from my leather couch my bedding and my clothes

sweepa duo rubber brush this worked best on my couch it was a bit labor intensive for me at least because the pet hair had become embedded in the leather we have a large sectional so by the time i had wiped the sides backs and seats of the couch i was winded and about 30 min had passed i had tried a bunch of other products prior to this and even the athome latex glove trick to no avail while hairs were still present on the couch this tool provided the most relief

fur zapper 2pack pet hair remover i wanted to love this but it just didnt work for me i see no less hair on clothes now than i did before i purchased these i also followed the suggestion to run dirty clothes in the dryer for a few minutes to loosen the pet hair prior to washing i did find some pet hair in the lint trap after this but not enough to take this extra step in my opinion

delomo pet grooming glove our dogs actually really enjoyed being groomed with this glove and we got an enormous amount of hair off the two of them it felt great to see it come off on the glove instead of floating around my house so this product is a keeper

gonzo pet hair lifter sponge this worked best on my clothes the terriers hair has a way to get embedded in material making it so hard to get out my sticky tape rolls would only go so far i would leave the house about 75 hairfree this sponge really did get up a lot of hair that was stuck in sweaters i did notice that after a few swipes the hair that had been removed by the sponge would get transferred to the sweater again i had a hard time getting the hair off the sponge until i tried thisafter a few passes with the sponge i would take my sticky tape roller and run it all over the sponge to pick up the hair on it then go back to my sweater with the sponge and repeat

i have yet to find a product that works effectively across multiple surfaces if anyone has a suggestion please share but i am pleased with the rubber brush for my couch the glove for pet grooming and the pet hair lifter for clothes i would not purchase the fur zapper again",-,very good,very good,-,very good
we have a 6mo golden retriever puppy  the hair has been unremovable at times  i find myself taperolling dark shirts after the dryer to get the hair off  i like these they definitely work in the dryer however they do seem to lose that real sticky silicone feeling after just a few loads yes i wash them too in warm soapy water  i do not use them in the washer  the bounce dryer sheets are absolutely the best however they do not work well on low temp  these seem to work on any temp so i will continue to use them for my low temp loads,-,very good,very good,-,very good
"could be a quality check on the one i received as i get most but not all or enough of pet hairs out of clothing blankets towels pillows bedding etc

for reference i have possibly the holy trinity of pet hairs for cat 3 cats short medium and long and one medium haired shepsky they all shed a lot even the short haired cat who is a black cat but i wear a lot of black its hard to tell my dogs hair is notorious for digging into fabrics and using most of all different types of pet hair brushes and other tools for furniture clothing and other its impossible to remove most of the hairs embedded in the fabric

so this product didnt fully meet my expectations but again it could be a quality check issue on mine ive had it for few months now and it either never improved or worsen so it still sorta works

these work better in the dryer than washer however you really notice the difference in your lint trap when using 4 or more zappers2 or more packs also some people in my household are forgetting to wash these with hot water and dishsoap before starting their laundry load and say they dont work if you follow the directions they work great thumbs up,-,very good,-,-,very good
i was very excited to see this product as i have 1 dog and 2 cats and pet hair gets on everything i used as instructed and was expecting to see fluffs of hair stuck to this when i finally got it out of the dryer almost no pet hair was on them “ok” i thought maybe it was too large a laundry load so i tried again and got the same result after about 2 weeks of using these in every laundry load i can say that my experience was almost no pet hair came off onto this product i will say that on occasions i would see gobs of human hair stuck to this thanks to my daughter robust head of curls so this product did not work on the pet hair as i expected but is instead keeping my daughters hair off of everyones clothes,-,neutral,-,-,neutral
i wanted something to eliminate the pet hair these for great reviews but im not super impressed with them yah they are decent and they kind of work i did not see any results when they were in the washer maybe that is just suppose to clean them up or something but didnt see results there in the dryer i saw little results i really expected these things to come out covered in hair nope they had hair of them but not a lot i noticed after doing a few loads i could find random clumps of hair stuck together i dont think that is how these are supposed to work but thats the results i got from them i really want to love these and thought these would be amazing i give them 3/5 concept is great they kind of work but not really i wouldnt buy them again ill keep researching to find something that works,-,very good,-,very good,very good

"if amazon basics really wants their brand to be associated with being a good “value” rather than “cheap” and “dirty” alternative to better brands and products they really should be focusing more on user experience from product design to purchase delivery  its that last one where amazon is really noticeably failing with their freezer bags  for want of a simple protective wrapper for shipping the entire first impression of this product was irrevocably tainted and lost

amazon please focus more on value and less on being expediently cheap  being thrifty is a good thing  being a cheapskate that cuts corners is not

also amazon when it comes to user experience its the little details that ultimately matter more than spreadsheet management would seem to assume

anyway folks

if youre looking for an alternative to name brand freezer bags like ziploc amazon basics might be acceptable  but they are noticeably not the same in quality or user experience  similar but definitely not the same

like others we cautiously decided to try the amazon basics freezer bags because the price was usually competitive and the reviews seemed genuinely positive for the most part

the product quality is okay but where the seal attaches to the bag the plastic is drawn apparently from the heat of attaching the seal to the opening of the bag  weve not had any of them tear along that seam so hopefully though it creates a visual point of concern it wont be an issue for you either

these freezer bags look smaller but that appears to be because they utilize an expandable gusset similar to the “stand and fill” freezer bags made by others  if you prefer your bags to lie flat this may become an issue  our solution has been to slightly underfill the bags to get them to lie evenly flat on shelves and in drawers in the freezer

however all of those relative positives being said for amazon basics ziploc freezer bags are noticeably a little better because they seal and unseal more easily consistently repeatedly and reliably than amazon basics  ziploc freezer bags seem to make the transition from food use in the kitchen to a second life elsewhere like the garage a bit better  again ziplocs better designed zip seal makes it more reliably recyclable and reusable  ziploc also designs their bags with a larger tab on one side that makes it easier and more stable to open so you have no worries about it being difficult to open or contents spilling out everywhere  you can also feel and see the seal on ziploc freezer bags zip open and closed the seal on amazon basics freezer bags requires a few more passes with your fingers to make sure that they are properly and completely sealed closed well

amazon basics though almost always beats ziploc on price unless you buy your ziploc freezer bags from costco especially when costco has them on sale

the huge negative in our experience in buying amazon basics freezer bags is that when shipping the product from the amazon warehouses to you amazon is overly miserly and cheap because rather than put the box of freezer bags in any kind of sealed packaging or simply wrapping it amazon actually puts a half dozen shipping labels and stickers all over the actual freezer bag box itself and tosses it from point to point to point all along its way from warehouse to truck to warehouse to delivery vehicle to the floor of your porch or dropped on your steps no matter the weather rain sleet snow sun or curious animals  so the actual freezer bag box is always covered in a layer of fine dirt and dust and to keep the box from opening along the perforated edge that youll need to remove in order to open the box to extract your freezer bags amazon slaps its big shipping label across the entire perforated opening  have fun removing that and dealing with the adhesive residue  so as anyone who has ever removed multiple amazon shipping labels knows you cannot get all of the labels off and where you can get some of the labels off youre left with adhesive on the box and parts of the box torn off with any labels removed

sooooo if you dont mind getting a box of freezer bags that are somewhat less in quality but generally lower in price than ziploc freezer bags and if you dont mind the actual box being dirty covered in labels and left damaged by the whole shipping ordeal you might be okay with amazon basics freezer bags

at this point were probably going to wait until we run low again to see whether costco has our preferred ziploc freezer bags on sale again  if not we may actually risk buying these again and see whether were forced to spend a half hour cleaning the box removing labels to get into the freezer bags box and trying to resolve the adhesive residue which are all apparently part of amazons intended user experiencethinking faceface with rolling eyes",very good,very good,very good,very good,very good

3i find it effective as i can feel the difference in last two days and it really attracts bugs and mosquito and kills them of course not 100 effective as i have it open environment
4 easy to clean killed bugs
4 long one year warranty

the only thing that i feel could be improved is the design its looks like generic product by one company but being sold by different brand names or just the body for most of them is same but quality of electronics used may be different this product so far looks great and hoping that it has better circuit compared to other similar looking products",-,very good,-,very good,very good

"i bought a few sets of the swiffer dusters to get the included holders of different lengths some came with the 180 duster and some with the 360 heavy duty duster both duster refills fit on all of the handles in the last 6 weeks or so that i have been using these dusters i prefer the 360 heavy duty duster over the 180 duster since it holds a lot more dust and lasts longer the 180 duster still has uses for getting under electronics that dont have much space under them or for getting into smaller areas

in my opinion neither of these dusters do much for more than a light layer of dust but they do help a lot to quickly remove dust they make it much easier to keep up with a dreaded chore so heavy duty cleaning is necessary less often they work best on smooth and flat surfaces the cottony fibers can get caught on knickknacks and figures that are not smooth

"first to address the elephant in the room  if you mix a noncolorfast red or black garment or any dark noncolorfast cloth  in the wash with a lighter colored garment these will not spare you from the agony of discovering a laundry tub full of pink underwear or gray tees  ive learned the hard way

that said i use these sheets with every load of laundry i wash and am very pleased with the results

when i wash a load of whites they remain a crisp white  despite my tendency to overbleach they no longer turn toward a yellowish tint or gray tint  in fact old sheets towels and tshirts that were discolored to that telltale gray or yellow have actually had an astonishing amount of their original bright whiteness restored  the color catcher doesnt fare as well  at the end of the whites cycle it comes out looking gray or rust colored

when i toss color catchers in with my colored clothing wash i dont sort colors much except to wash very dark colors or new clothing separately  again ive learned the hard way  more than once  the sheet comes out of the wash with a hodgepodge of colors on it that i will call “vomit”  my clothing?  bright and crisp colors

regarding my colored clothing i assumed for pretty much my entire adult life that most of my wardrobe faded in the wash  after just a few washes colors would be less vibrant faded looking even dingy  these color catchers have really extended the life of my clothing and i have tees ive washed weekly for over two years that are still bright and new looking  thats not an exaggeration

i think if a person sets their expectations properly between reality and fantasy they will fall in love with these color catchers  i absolutely will not do laundry without them  again they wont stop noncolorfast fabrics from ruining an entire load of light colors  but they will attract and lock the little bits of dye that might leach from your average wash and wear clothing  they will also pull dirt from the wash water as my husbands work uniforms clearly demonstrate  and they attract and lock in rust chlorine and other hard water contaminants that are probably making your clothing look faded and dingy  sorcery

these sheets are nothing short of amazing  i truly hope they are never discontinued",-,very good,-,very good,very good
"i have a striped sweater that i absolutely love which is white on top with a thick band of tan beneath it and a thick band of black at the bottom  after many many times of washing the sweater with darks mostly the white part turned a dingy grey  i didnt know what i could possibly do about it or how i could prevent newer clothes from suffering the same fate so i started doing some online homework  i didnt even know these color catchers existed

ive used these color catchers in a few loads now and i am amazed  i had a brand new black sweatshirt that i washed with a load of mostly darks with a couple of pairs of white socks  i threw in a color catcher to see if the white socks would stay white  sure enough the color catcher soaked up the black dye and my white socks stayed white

then i set about trying to cure my poor sweater that had gone dingy grey at the top  i soaked the top halfish of the sweater in a bucket of warm water with oxiclean  after about an hour or so i put the sweater in the wash with just a few other items and a color catcher sheet  i set it to have an extra rinse at the end too  after that wash the sweater came out much brighter on top and the color catcher sheet turned the exact dingy grey that used to be on my sweater  i think the oxi loosened up the old transferred dye and most of it ended up on the color catcher instead of redepositing on my sweater  seriously i thought i was going to have to throw away this sweater but it looks so much better now that its back in my regular rotation  its not as white as it was brandnew but its probably 75 as bright which is a huge accomplishment from where it started maybe 25 as bright

the cost of these sheets is so small compared to having to replace sweaters that had gotten muddled colors from dye transfer  im definitely going to be using these on the regular from now on

oh and i think someone mentioned somewhere that these dye catchers need to be put into a separate delicates bag so they dont clog up your machine or something but i threw mine in without any bag and it held up just fine  your results may vary but my lg frontloaders didnt chew it up or have any issues with it at all",very good,very good,very good,-,very good
i use these when i have a smaller load of clothes and dont need to use two machines for whites and lighter colors  i also use them in dark loads like blue jeans because they absorb the extra dyes that always come out with new clothes  i have saved many outfits and sheets by throwing one or two of these in the laundry machines in our apartment complex  highly recommended,-,very good,-,-,very good
i noticed a significant price increase  i also noticed some companies selling the 24 count for the same price as the 72 count box amazon paid attention to details and had not made that error i purchased the 72 count box for a little over 12 pricey but i can combine loads of wash saving water electricity and time it absorbs colors and i have not noticed  strange colors on clothing so it seems to do its job in cold and warm wash loads the directions say to put the color absorbing sheet in a mesh bag etc to keep from going into or through the pump well all brands say this but it is of such a strong and thick product it has not caused any pump issues in my large front loading machine without the  bag other brands are so thin and lightweight i always put them in a mesh bag to protect the machine  it would be rated 5 stars for everything if it didnt need a mesh bag and didnt have a price increase  the product does its job and the box has clear directions,very good,very good,very good,very good,very good
i put these to a test and washed a new red tank top in with white sheets  the shout sheet absorbed all the red color and my sheets are still white great product,-,-,-,-,-

"while not all batteries are created equal in my experience if i invest in a name brand like duracell or energizer i generally get a parity product theyre more or less indistinguishable from one another in my experience so i go with whatever is less expensive at the time

so with not much to distnguish batteries i wound up being really struck and pleased by something quite mundane the packaging

heretofore ive only received batteries in the incredibly wasteful spaceinefficient packaging that involves a combination of a cardboard back and a clear plastic front this creates a tetrislike nightmare in the box in which i keep my batteries instead the utter simplicity and plasticfree as a bonus of a small rectangular cardboard box packed to the brim with  wait for it  batteries and nothing else seriously its so basic this had to have been close to the original packaging back when engineering ruled before the age of design and better for the environment to boot hope i can buy all of my batteries going forward in such a simple rationale packaging",very good,-,very good,very good,very good

now some may be wondering why did  one outlast the other? in my opinion the cheaper ones are like your dollar store brand theyll do the job but for how long? if you want to nerd out on the details of all these batteries theres a  comment in here where someone breaks down each one and gives you scientific results",very good,very good,very good,-,very good

"i highly recommend licb as a company and their batteries for their quality and safety when buying batteries from overseas companies its important to be aware of potential complications including compatibility issues lowquality materials and safety risks licb batteries are known for their stable voltage output longlasting power and compatibility with a wide range of electronic devices licb is based out of china and is a relatively smaller company but has a global presence commitment to quality and safety and a reputation to protect its why their name is written on the box each individual battery package and battery you recieve from them they stand behind their products

licb uses highquality materials in its batteries and adheres to strict manufacturing standards to ensure that its products meet or exceed industry safety requirements additionally licb batteries are designed to be environmentally friendly with a focus on reducing waste and minimizing the impact of battery disposal on the environment the company also offers a oneyear warranty on its products and responsive customer support ensuring that any issues or defects are promptly addressed

the packaging of the licb batteries is thoughtful with 2 blister sheet packs that make it easy to push out a single battery without disturbing the others this saves time and frustration and makes it easier to store the batteries in a neat and organized way when the sr44 battery was used in an electronic digital caliper i just bought it worked right out of the package without any issues saving time and worry about performance

one of the best things about this product is the fact that you get 20x sr44 batteries for less than 6 from a reputable company this is a great value especially considering the source of these batteries and they last for a long time an sr44 battery will last in a lowpower device thats not used much can go for years depending on the power requirements and frequency of use for example if youre using an sr44 battery in a digital thermometer that you only bust out every once in a while it could last for three to five years or maybe even more same goes for a watch that you dont wear often its good just having a supply of them on hand for other devices

licb batteries are a reliable choice for batteries they offer quality safety and customer service making them a popular choice globally the product is affordable with quick delivery i got mine next day and the batteries work well right out of the package this is a great value and a great source for anyone who needs a reliable source of sr44 batteries for their small electronical devices from a reputable company",very good,very good,very good,very good,very good

the long life of this battery pack is one of its best qualities these batteries have lasted a long time in the many tiny electrical gadgets ive been using them in such calculators and remote controls this is fantastic because it eliminates the need for frequent battery replacement
the price of this device is another fantastic feature these batteries are reasonably priced when compared to other brands which is a significant advantage i found a pack of 20 batteries for a fairly affordable price so i will have plenty of extra batteries on hand for future use

the fact that these batteries are difficult to access is one drawback when you need to replace a battery right away it can be aggravating because the packaging is so challenging to open if the maker could make the box simpler to open and use that would be fantastic
the licb 20 pack battery are all things considered a superb deal for the money they are an excellent option for anyone who needs batteries for small electrical gadgets because of their long lasting life and low price although the packing could be better this is a small issue that doesnt affect the batteries overall quality",very good,very good,very good,very good,very good

it cleans very well is not a disinfectant  but ive used it on my induction stovetop for a very quick clean after a gross grease mess that had dried on  it really surprised me  cleaned everything very well with little effort and zero streaking the cleaner that the manufacturer recommends leaves a cloud  this is amazing

used it on granite counters with no streaking and it grabbed a dried on spot with ease  i just wish it were disinfecting as well but it is great for a fast cleanup and it is staying on my counter i just need to get past the odor upon spraying  i had to take off a star for that because it was so unexpected but do not let that deter you from purchasing because as i said  a  my son does not have the same reaction so it could just be me unlikely lol and b  it does dissipate very quickly

definitely will purchase again",-,very good,-,-,very good

theres something about the unstoppable scent that is perfection i only use a fraction of the suggested amount on large loads and my laundry comes out smelling strong and fresh it really lasts too even items that have been in my closet for months still smell exactly the same as when i washed them the only downside is the price yes theres a lot of product in the container but i feel as though it really should not cost as much as amazon charges so i took a star off i do recommend this product though and this scent comes in multiple room and fabric fresheners as well as wax melts to always keep your home smelling like fresh laundry,very good,very good,very good,very good,very good

"i thought this would be another tiktok fad that was overhyped this actually works really well it reminds me a lot of a magic eraser but doesnt scratch at all this means it doesnt scrub the same but there is no danger of taking off paint from walls i think it is most useful for dusting troublesome areas like baseboards it attracts animal hair like no business

what i love most about this toilet paper is that it is made from highquality materials and does not leave any residue or lint behind which can be a common problem with other brands it also has the perfect amount of thickness and absorbency making it a great choice for everyday use

"i wanted a 2nd spin mop style product so i could take my previous set to church and use it when its my cleaning week i loved my first set  its generic but had two buckets that could come apart and had a drain plug this allowed me to dump water all in the one bucket when finished and then take only the drain plug bucket and dump it this is very important to me due to an arthritic disability and lifting more than a gallon milk jug is difficult but remaining independent is important

i looked hard in the description to find a drain plug and couldnt find one but the idea this had two pieces made me wonder if i could make it work

the cool part to this spin mop is its design to keep clean and dirty water separate? thats something no one has accomplished the set up was super easy the lift to allow clean water and cleaner into the bucket was something i could achieve myself its large and easy to grip without the ability of fine motor skills the plug to fill warm water with and cleaning solution is also easy to lift and remove

i have a small home and so the three spaces i need to clean is probably about the size of a mater bedroom these days so i only filled it half way therefore lifting was easy

i actually was most excited by the simple thing on the handle there is a little notch to attach your adjustable mop handle too how many of you know trying to stand a mop up somewhere so it doesnt fall over and make that scary sound for a dog or if you area real mommaybe a new baby or child im ony a fur mom and it startles mine sometimes and even myself

lastly is the foot pump to spin the mop and the mop head is reusable by washing machine and leave out to dry my generic mop i had to press down onto the spinner for it to spin easy as it sounds to some it takes a lot of effort and uses energy requiring myself more rest breaks to complete a mopping job by myself the foot pump is simple no effortless

i think i seen this sold 40k or more im not one to follow a crowd but seeing as im gonna use this at least once a week at home and the old one goes to church for my once a month cleaning week im super excited to own this and praying it allows my to continue to be able to do my own household cleaning without help and maintaining my independence since im 43 years old young still",-,very good,very good,very good,very good
"ive been wanting one of these since it came out i finally decided to order it and when i opened ed the box i was a little disapointed because i did not get  a telescoping handlei got a 3 peice twist together red handle does not telescope
that was the first thing 
the secind thing is that the pull tab for the water to flow into the bucket it needs a better seal meaning when you go to pour water into the blue coean water chamber even if the red lever is closed it still starts flowing water into that clean side luckily it isnt a whole lot but it is still annoying when you assumed it would be a complete shut off valve
and then third and last the empty process if you want to try and empty the top blue water side since that water would be cold if you tried to use it again later it would be better if it had a drain valve on the bottom or side or something to emoty out the water you dont use since we usually want to disinfect with hot water

overall the product is pretty cool its enjoyable to mop with and seems to do a good job
i do however want to say that i personally am fine without a telescoping handle anyways as i am 56 and it works well for me and i have a wallclamp type thing place to hop my mop handle too
also beings that i did not ever have the original version the mop head was quite fluffy and pretty good sized for my home
i have tons of animals and traffic in and out of my house so it will be perfectly fine although i will order extras from temu you can get 3 or 5 packs for about 68 ok handok handok handok handok hand
its a good purchase tho im glad i waited for the price to drop on it 49 is what i paid id say its worth that for sure",very good,very good,-,very good,very good
i have an elderly and seriously ill dog 16 with 5 cancers  she is having issues with holding her pee for more than a few hours  i was going through a roll of paper towels a day and decided to try this instead  i love this system and in particular this clean rinse  i can quickly clean up the mess rinse with fresh water and remop  i am certain the mess is thoroughly cleaned up and i am not just pushing around pee water  this spin mechanism is also brilliant and works really well  the floors can be dry really quick if the mop is spun further  i highly recommend  i was unsure which spin mop to buy watched a few videos and decided to go with the slightly more expensive model for the clean rinse aspect  so glad i did and i would highly recommend this for just regular cleaning too  love this mop love the mop head is washable and just think this product is outstanding in every aspect,very good,very good,-,-,very good
i have about 2500 sf of floor tile to maintain with two fur babies and a husband living in the house  i own a steam mop and swifter wet mop  even with these tools cleaning the floor is back breaking and time consuming  and i am oftentimes putting back the dirt i just removed  i must have viewed this product a hundred times  i just decided to purchase in the hope it would make life easier and give me cleaner tile floors  i received it yesterday and all i can say is wow  what an amazing difference  i mopped my floors in record time without breaking my back  the spin action lets you leave as much or as little water in the mop head your hands never touch water  the mop head can get into tight corners or under furniture  you can mop with just water or you can add a cleaning solution  when i emptied the water out i saw dirty water in the secondary chamber  this product is truly one of the best purchases ive ever made,-,very good,very good,-,very good

many positive things about this toiletwand disposable toilet cleaning kit  this has to be the most sanitary easy toilet cleaning kit on the market  it does exactly what it advertises  the throwaway brushes after one cleaning is ideal so the nasty germs dont drip and stay trapped inside the holder for the wand  a simple click into place of the cleaning pad and youre good to go  it cleaned so much more gunk out from under the rim too  wow  the scent is refreshing but not overpowering the toilet gets cleaned more easily than my previous big old clunky brush attached to the plastic handled cleaning tool that would sit in a holder dripping and collecting more dirt  truly this is a zip zip and youre done cleaning tool  ive already recommended to all my children and many friends  you wont be disappointed,-,very good,-,-,very good
i find reusable toilet brushes to be so disgusting so opted for this when i moved to my new house it works great is more hygienic and takes up less space i have 3 toilet and use one sponge for all three i move ut around in a plastic bag which i then throw out once done i still use toilet bowl liquid cleaner and then use the sponges to scrub around because its a flat sponge i get a much better clean never going back to brushes again,-,very good,-,-,very good
i dont know if its the over amount of cleaning product on each of the little sponge things but hot damn this thing makes my toilet sparkle like the chrysler building  easy to use  super great product  so much better than my 80s toilet cleaner and comet  bought it for my elderly fatherinlaw and showed him how to use it now i may be able to pee next time im at his house,-,very good,very good,-,very good
personally i really liked this brush its so easy to use it and i think its such a smart idea to make the brush part disposable i spend way less time cleaning the toilet and the product is very effective i know some of the reviews say it detaches easily while youre cleaning so that made me hesitant to purchase but i have not come across that at all the only reason i give 4 stars is because i really wish the stick was attachable to the container its a bit of a hassle storing the stick apart from it,-,very good,very good,very good,very good
en realidad el producto hace bastante espuma si contiene el suficiente clorox habia visto este producto en redes sociales y las personas mencionaban que era muy sucio meter el disco a la tasa para que hiciera espuma y despues lavar la tasa por fuera que transportabas todas las bacterias al asiento mi tip que les quiero dar es que al utilizarlo primero moje el disco en el lavamanos y despues de eso limpie toda el area del asiento por ultimo fue que lo introduci dentro de la tasa ya despues de eso deseche el disco a la basura ya que son desechables ojala sirva de algo mi consejo,-,-,-,-,-

i was raised using dish rags yeah im old like wash cloths but only for washing dishes not bodies while i was visiting some friends a few years ago i wanted to help out  volunteered to wash dishes they used this kind of sponge scotch brite nonscratch scrub sponges i was hesitant at first thinking it was going stink or get moldy in no time but to my surprise there was no smell at all when taking it out of the package i got it wet  put one pump of dish soap in the center of the sponge side  squished it a bit to get the whole sponge soapy the slight s shape of the sponge is key making it very comfortable to hold no matter what youre cleaning the reverse side has a gentle scrubber which can be used on nonstick cookware without scratching it at all washing dishes this way without a sink full of soapy water saves gallons of water  lots of time since then ive exclusively been using this particular brand  shape of sponge the blue ones i keep one in the kitchen for dishes countertops  the inside  outside of the refrigerator  one in the bathroom for the sink  tub as long as i rinse them out well  set them to dry in a shallow soap dish on the kitchen  bathroom counters they dry quickly  dont have any smell i buy the big package of 9 sponges for 674 which comes out to only 75 cents each id say each kitchen sponge lasts a good 2 to 3 weeks when i have enough dishes to use the dishwasher the sponge goes on the top rack for thorough cleaning  disinfecting with the extremely hot water  its good as new dont put it in the microwave to clean youll ruin it i have to say im utterly shocked as the photos sent with some other bad reviews ive never had a sponge break off from the scrubbing side never had them so filthy as in the pictures never had them crumble apart or any of the other nasty stuff shown in those photos my guess is that they were used improperly for heavy duty work like floor scrubbing or cleaning ovensthese are not designed for that type of use for too long  never cleaned i also saw complaints that the new sponges were wet when the package was opened all good quality sponges are supposed to be just the slightest bit damp when new or else by the time you get them theyd be dry  brittle misshapen  crackedthe dampness is not a fault or anything to complain about i highly  sincerely recommend these wonderful very affordable sponges my guests are so impressed with them im always giving out one for them to take home to try ill never go back to old dish rags,very good,very good,very good,very good,very good

"i was skeptical that using this would be much better than a normal bounce sheet but when you have 3 greyhounds in the house pet hair is a given no matter how much you keep up with it

"these are the best kitchen garbage bags in my opinion  slightly bigger than the standard 13gallon bags these are much easier to get into the garbage can they hold more and arent overflowing when you pull a full bag out of the can and they still hold tight around the rim  the force flex feature does help the bag not rip but it will if you shove something sharp or pointy in there  still better than a standard plastic bag

im not huge on artificial scents but this scent is subtle  just enough to cover the smell of the garbage but not overwhelming every time you open the garbage lid i barely notice it but i like that its there

kitchen garbage bags are maybe a strange thing to get super particular about but i have become so and these are the best  hard to find in stores so i stock up on them here  do yourself a favor and upgrade your trash bag  it might change your life",-,very good,very good,very good,very good
ive enjoyed the pink trash bags after years of using reliable dull blah grey or white flexible bags i bought them on sale hoping the manufactured fragrance wouldnt be horrible surprisingly i like the fragrance  have had no leakage or tearing even when overfull  the bag becomes less opaque but never see through i havent figured it out yet but it seems like i went through 13 gallon grey bags faster than these 13 gallon pink ones  shrugs should byers cluelessly ,-,very good,-,-,very good

"i had tried many different garbage bags and always had issues

i have subscribe and save so i ended up trying these i looked at them and thought they looked so weird they are fantastic though

1 they fit my garbage can

3 never had a rip or tear even when overfilled

i wish they werent so expensive but they are definitely worth it",very good,-,-,-,very good

absolutely amazing highly recommend by far the best papers/ cones on the market still the only papers out that i dont taste paper when consuming cones are my absolute favorite order you some cones get some good kush  fill away too easy id highly suggest for newbie tokens to get the cone pack with the filler card  poker for a few bucks more,-,very good,-,-,very good

buying bulk is much more cost effective than at the store or even local head shops i guess depending on if they do the same or not it always ships fast and is packaged well never stale the product itself is durable in comparison to competition it has a minimal flavor factor which i prefer to taste what i am consuming rather than paper so thats a big plus lastly the filter makes it easy to not get smelly fingers as much and much less jailbreak crumbs winking face with tongue,very good,-,very good,very good,very good

"we have been using these hefty recycle bags for decades not kidding and were satisfied with the quality and the price recently we noticed the bags got thinner and tore much easier which didnt happen before we had only shredded paper in the bag when it tore at its seams imagine all that fun cleaning the micro shreds of paper all over the floor we had to use two bags instead of one which makes mandatory recycling expensive

its understandable that manufacturers are trying to cut cost and raise their prices but if the quality suffers why would an educated consumer in their right mind continue to buy their product? if thats the case we might as well just order generic bags at a lower price

conclusion if you can get these bags on sale and they are priced competitively go for yours otherwise look somewhere else apparently brand loyalty is not appreciated by hefty",neutral,neutral,neutral,-,neutral
i didnt know that recycling bags existed lol i was told you can get them amazon we only have 1 recycling bin and for the recycling it gets picked up once a week so it gets overfill these bags came in handy i place mostly bottles in it since it takes up room in the recycling bin definitely keeps it organized i recommend it,-,-,-,very good,very good

"living in soflo ive been at war with mold underneath the toilet rim after speaking to my momshe lives 1 hr north of tampa i found out this is a florida thing along with hard water
ive tried so many different things tank cleaners with beachboraxthe ones you hang over the rim into toiletas well as the kind that you stick in with dispenser none of them was very much help not to mention all the different kinds of  toilet bowl cleaners
when this came in i told hubby i was going to have another battle with the toilet i try to find humor in frustrating situations
so following the directions flused then used this cleaner i then cleaned the sinkshowerbaseboards  outside of the toilet  i definitely wanted to give the cleaner a little time to work
so using my toilet brush the battle began this battle i actually won the war is never ending but i have a really great weapon with thus cleaner

i tend to be more frugal or some may say even cheap when it comes to buying stuff like this however i am willing to spend a few more bucks if its a really good product that im excited to try out seeing how many reviews this hadi had to shell out a few more bucks to see what all the hype is about this is one of those products that does truly live up to the hype and is worth every penny you honestly dont need to scrub most dishes surfaces ect when you use this miracle in a bottle i love how clean it gets an array of items and surfaces with just a single or two sprays i always clean my shower/tub out before my son or i use it and just spray it along the walls and on the shower mat and let it sit for awhilesometimes i forget about it but it doesnt leave a gross looking o feeling residue and when i go to wash it off i always notice how sparkly clean the whole shower and tub areespecially cos our dog tends to jump in there to lock the faucet when its dripping so ill see some dirty paw prints in there and spray em leave it sitting for awhile then come back and rinse off with high powered shower head and its perfect zero scrubbing unless its like something really caked on but usually when using a high powered sink or shower head it almost always gets everything off and rarely ever need to scrub which i feel is actually keeping things more clean since scrub brushes tend to harbor bacteria and just grossness this plus the refill last a considerably long time as im on the last bit of the refill and didnt need to put the refill on until maybe a couple of weeks with moderate usageas a little goes a long way for sure with this so it can even be saving you money depending how you wanna look at it grinning squinting face love this stuff and im not huge on the typical chemically soappy scent but its not too strong unless youre using a lot in an unventilated area but its never made me get light headed or anything so its pretty safe for the most part but it does have a somewhat strong smell but nothing different or any worse than any other similar products and i have allergies too and this never has bothered me or made me sneeze really surprised by how much this impressed me and will be continuing to buy it,very good,very good,very good,very good,very good
"5223~ been just about a month and heres what i found~
 really is a spray  wipe no soak situation on anything
 cleaned that weirdly sticky residue off the toaster oven pan
 almost removed all the old discoloration on the bottom of the pans
 turned a sticky spot no clue how it got under the kitchen mat into an easy wipe
  tried all purpose cleaner 1st and the stain laughed at me powerwash? gone
 cleaned the grate at the base of the fridge with no toothbrush
 melted slimy soap under the shower bottles in minutes  cleaned whole tub

in full disclosure the tougher scrubs did require a couple tries but powerwash did all the work

i could go on but feel you should know i do not like to clean not even a little
some friends seem to enjoy it i am not one of those people
if i am scrubbing you should probably wonder what you did wrong  ignore the mumbling

so while i keep seeing dawn powerwash at friends  luxury homes i wasnt convinced
luxury homes as in i cater on weekends  its on every countertop when i set up food
i looked into it but i like my mrs meyers  small 129 dawn for tough jobs

what finally broke me was my go to scrub could not remove the oil sticky from toaster tray
so i gave in ordered the spray  refill now i get why you need the refill
you find everything in your house to try it on bc its so quick easy  satisfying

next thing you know youre on your knees at 10 pm cleaning your fridge grate

its instant gratification  its cleaning without the mental prep
its scrubbing bubbles for your worse stuck on mess
and it lasts after almost a month just passed the halfway mark on the 1st bottle

its a keeper to turn tiger tough scrubs into pussycats",-,bad,-,bad,bad
"a friend of mine told me about dawn powerwash and declared it an absolute necessity for my home as someone who doesnt really clean naturally im a slob i decided to go ahead and give it a try

wowsers this stuff is incredible

i ordered and received the dawn powerwash spray starter kit platinum dish soap fresh scent 1 starter kit  1 dawn powerwash refill each bottle is 16ounces and this is a solid value in addition to being a great product

the sprayer is easy to use and reusable its also easy to use it on the refill everything works exactly as described

this powerwash also works as a degreaser and is honestly really stunning even on truly grimy dishes and dishes ive allowed to sit a bit too long

i will probably try the other scents however this fresh scent is truly awesome they do also offer a free  clear option i may use since i can be a bit sensitive to products though so far ive not had any issues if you are sensitive however id likely start with the free  clear option to avoid concerns

overall im finding this to be an absolute winner it makes doing dishes an easier job  a nice thing for a paraplegic with somewhat spastic hands i will no doubt be making this my go to option for washing dishes",very good,very good,-,very good,very good
"okay i try not to buy too much gimmicky stuff and plastic but
damn this stuff works so well ive always used dawn that i buy in bulk to fill a small bottle by the sink
now its just this spray its good so good but watch for the blast of alcohol that pops out when you spray keep your head away when you spray
twice product arrived damaged and leaking",-,very good,-,very good,very good
i have been using this since it came out i usually buy form the store but today i didnt have any time to get to the store i had a busy schedule today so i ordered it this morning for a same day delivery this dish soap is amazing it cuts through grease so well for tough stuff i spray it  let it sit for 1015 minutes the grease just rinses off i will never purchase another dish soap again,-,-,very good,-,very good

before i used those antiseptic wipes to clean the outside of the toilet and they were kind of a pain  and expensive now i spray on a cleaner let it sit a minute then wipe off with a damp cloth and i find it much faster and easier a thick cloth feels less icky than using a thin antiseptic wipe and its easier to hold onto as i clean",very good,very good,-,-,very good
"this review is for amazon basics microfiber cleaning cloths nonabrasive reusable and washable  pack of 24 12 x16
colorfast and with a nice edging that does not ravel  i have not tried using these for deep cleaning

having read some comments that machine laundering may gradually reduce their effectiveness i wash them by hand and hang to dry unless they are unusually dirty  no fabric softeners of course as they reduce absorption  i keep clean cloths handy for wiping down the chrome fixtures in the kitchen bathroom sinks and showerexpecting by these means to prevent spots of corrosion from developing because the water in so cal being very hard
i have also found them very good for cleaning our brushed stainless steel refrigerator and magic chef microwave oven  we wanted a white fridge but constraints of sizing and supply forced us to buy stainless and i was worried because many people write about how it shows fingerprints  the company selling it also sells a special compound to remove them but i found a diy online that calls only for white vinegar and a cloth that leaves no fuzzie microfiber  keeping a spray bottle of vinegar and one of these cloths handy i have found that fingerprinting is no problem whatsoever
if anyone here is considering getting microfiber cloths for cleaning stainless steel appliances be aware that brushed stainless steel has a sort of grain to it  you can see very tiny lines all going in one direction that is the brushing  spray a bit of the vinegar on a microfiber cloth and wipe in the direction of the grain to remove dirt and fingerprints  wipe again with a dry section of the cloth to remove any residue of vinegar which seems to remove the necessity of rinsing and if any fingerprints persist rewiping with a tiny bit of olive oil on the cloth somehow miraculously takes care of them  polish again with a clean part of the cloth and done  most of the time i find i am one and done” with just the vinegar and i love these cloths
i like that they came in white blue and yellow so i can assign different colors to different jobs  if there is anything particularly dirty or a potential for staining i plan to use the white ones for that so i can give them whatever laundry treatment seems necessary  by the way neither the blue nor the yellow has bled into the laundry water and caused trouble with white garments being washed together with these cloths  i recall reading a comment about such bleeding and can only assume that it refers to a different product as amazon sometimes lumps together the reviews for similar but not identical products",-,poor,poor,poor,poor
it is nice to get a whole package of theseplenty to always have some ready they wash up nicely they are slightly smaller than i would prefer they are rectangle and i would have preferred a slightly larger square shape but overall i am happy also for people who care about color i like that these are calm soothing colors,-,-,-,very good,very good

i recently purchased the acdelco 48count aaa batteries and have been using them for a few weeks now so far i have been impressed with their performance they seem to be good quality batteries and have worked well in all of my devices however i must admit i cant vouch for the 10year shelf life claim i mean who knows where ill be in 10 years let alone whether these batteries will still be alive and kicking but ill be sure to let you know in a decade or so all jokes aside i would definitely recommend these batteries for their power and longlasting performance,-,very good,-,-,very good
so they wont be tested for there 10 year shelf life at least not in this house ive only used them in a flashlight so far but they come with a full charge so its unlikely they were sitting on a shelf somewhere and have held up well enough that i cant tell you how long they last as they are still going,-,good,-,-,good
i like that these arrive in a compact cardboard case it is small with the aaa batteries wrapped in cellophane 3packs convenient if you need them on the go  there are 4 of us in the household and we all use them in everything from flashlights to remotes etc  a very good value,very good,very good,-,very good,very good
"i am now a strongly committed believer in this brand that outperforms by wide margins over the 2 brands which deliver the most hype through advertising i have always been a duracell customer and decided to purchase in quantity for all of the devices i have at home and i do a lot of traveling which requires the use of aaa batteries in mobile devices outside of typical smartphones etc

i stumbled upon a review for acdelco batteries which was done by a consumer who had battery discharge test equipment to measure the actual load and capacity of multiple brands of batteries ignoring all of the advertising hype which motivates people to buy one over another this reviewer tested all of the major brands taking brand new batteries of each and putting them through a regimen of uses to see how quickly they drained under various loads he had a battery discharge measuring device opus which draws specific levels of power from light to heavy loads and yields the results in a measurable way i love it when someone posts a review which peels back the skin of an onion to see what is really going on under the hood  in case you cant find his review i am quoting it in parentheses below after my comments

at first i was a bit bit surprised being a long time victim of duracell and everready advertising having never considered acdelco but then it made a lot of sense that this general motors company and brand has always equipped  their new cars with their own acdelco batteries it certainly makes sense that they might have a deeper brain trust of technology to deliver a superior small electronics battery at any rate i am extremely pleased that i stumbled upon his review which means a lot more to me than all of the advertising hype which does nothing to deliver any actual credible and unbiased information

the reviewer goes by the profile name of just c and is an amazon top 1000 reviewer his review is at the top of reviews for the acdelco battery page on amazon with the following link
https//wwwamazoncom/acdelcobatteriesalkalinebatteryperformance/dp/b00ff8kqjc/refpdsim1214?encodingutf8refridwyrqgk7z5sq285xrj6ssth1

c  top 1000 reviewer
50 out of 5 stars6 brands tested capacity test results  a clear winner
october 31 2015

i couldnt find a review stating the tested capacity of the leading aaa batteries on amazon so i took it upon myself to find out for each of the 6 types ive tested acdelco amazonbasics duracell coppertop duracell procell energizer and rayovac i discharged 3 batteries in my opus btc2000 battery analyzer at rates of 100 ma 200 ma and 400 ma discharge rate affects usable capacity these acdelco batteries were among the top in capacity and stomped every other battery in terms of value with amazonbasics as a runnerup

the capacity at each discharge rate was

disch rt | capacity | runtime | sample use case
100 ma | 1005 mah | 101 hrs | lowpower led flashlight
200 ma | 864 mah | 43 hrs | electronic toy / medium led flashlight
400 ma | 670 mah | 17 hrs | motorized toy / bright led flashlight

i ran the acdelco batteries first and my original review i stated that though not topnotch these results are perfectly respectable well since then ive run 5 more brands and these are pretty close to topnotch the only other brand that managed to beat them in any category was amazonbasics but really amazonbasics and acdelco were at the top of the stack and the differences were probably within the margin of error put simply these batteries pack a lot of punch and theyre cheap for the cost ~10 as of this writing these are an excellent value  the power supplied per dollar spent is nearly unbeatable for a nonrechargeable aaa battery and the capacity is very nearly the best ive tested

i have not tested shelf life or leak resistance for any of the batteries in my roundup so its possible that some of the other batteries may do better in that regard the one thing i have learned is that a batterys marketing has nothing to do with its actual performance for power capacity  assuming that the same is true for storage youll have to wait until somebody runs a thorough leak and storage test to know which brand is best

i have posted reviews for duracell procell duracell coppertop energizer and amazonbasics aaa alkaline batteries with capacity data gathered using the exact same method and equipment i have attached a graph and table summarizing the results in the images to find the full reviews for the other brands for comparison purposes go to the product pages linked below and search for mah under all reviews or just browse to them on my profile end quote",very good,very good,very good,-,very good

after reading the reviews about issues with leaking which are true i came up with a system that worked for me i saved a day or two of veggie scraps at a time not letting them stay out long enough for the bag to deteriorate i put the bags in my freezer until i had a sizable amount then when i cleaned my chicken coop i took the bags out ripped them open and threw everything in my compost heap i made a nice hot pile and when i gave it a first turn i only found one tiny scrap of bag which will invariably break down in this next turn very pleased that the bags actually break down in a hot compost pile makes saving scraps much easier and rewarding,-,very good,very good,-,very good
"got to say i have just been a lucky shopper lately lol   first and foremost everybody has been so helpful in their reviews  it has really helped me make better buying decisions this holiday shopping season
   i decided i wanted to make sure i left detailed feedback on some of the purchases i made in the fall with the hopes that i might help someone else  i thought i was going to be leaving the good the bad the ugly  but i cant find a bad thing to say about these disposable hand towels
    when i decided that i wanted something like this for bedside i was thinking of it as a luxury purchase paper towels dispensed one at a time fancy
   it turned out that right from the beginning this pack of 6 individual boxes of the kleenex expressions hand towels in the one at a time box was a good value 
      when they arrived and i started using them i realized just what a gem i had found
  these are amazing   they truly are a 3 in 1 product
           they are as durable as any premium paper towel on a roll i have ever used  so they work great wet as a cleansing cloth   theyre very absorbent one towel dries your hands and forearms thoroughly without falling apart 
    they have this stretch to them  are perfect for holding a sandwich or some chips  sometimes i hate to throw them away the hold up so well 
     after using them to hold a snack ill often rinse my hands when im done eating dry them with the same towel  then take the damp towel and wipe down my tablet  absolutely lint free glass cleaning  thats use number 2 or 3 and why they would be amazing in the woodshop or the car
    thirdly and this is the best part for me they are crazy soft  i got a 6 pack of tissues at the same time i ordered these but these towels are truly just as soft as these tissues  
     i absolutely love that  i have been forever looking to find a tissue that could hold up to being used like a napkin when the need arises in the car or the bedside or kids room
     but wow a sturdy lint free paper towel that is as soft and gentle on my delicate nose a paper napkin that is as soft as a tissue is eve even better  
    i know i am going to be obnoxious about trying to get my family to try these   but i cant help it i always thought it was a problem to solve tissue falls apart / paper napkins are rough and now ive found a solution     
     so far so good with not irritating my sensitive skin but it is early days for that  so i will update about that when ive gone through a few boxes  this box is lasting me a long time  i keep thinking i am finding excuses and using too many  but that just goes to show you go through towels that cant do the job much faster
       i have medical issues and spend a lot of time in my bedroom so those are great uses for me  i would say the average household would love these in the bathroom where you guests and family can pull out just one clean towel after washing their hands   they dont need to touch a hand towel and the dont need to contaminate a whole role of paper towels trying to get one
   so great for kitchen bathrooms laundry rooms nurseries and my favorite place bedside   but be warned once your guests have felt how soft they are theyll be reaching over the tissue box and grabbing one of these if they feel a sneeze coming on",very good,very good,very good,very good,very good
i usually need two paper towels when drying my hands but these only require 1 love that you can easily pull out one paper towel at a time and the box is the perfect size to set on a small sink/counter top and no need for guests to share a hand towel,-,very good,very good,very good,very good
"kleenex expressions hand towels 6pk/carton
i discovered these in 2016 in a discount store someone forgot to pack hand towels for a vacation rental so asked me to look for some on my way i didnt see any hand towels id want to keep but did find these  they were a great choice  they dont take the boxes are attractive and small enough they could be put anywhere  we used them on countertops and upside down sitting on top of a towel rack as shown on the boxes  i started buying these 2 or 3 packs at a time for my powder room  i spotted them in a small display in my grocery store but the cost added up  i was pleased to find them being sold in bulk 6 packs on amazon and at a savings  the carton usually comes with 2 boxes each of 3 different patterns  this was probably my 5th or 6th order and this time 2 of the patterns changed a little ive included pictures of one in the powder room and another in the guest bathroom
they have been gray  white white  gold and beige  gold  this time two changed slightlyone being more gray and the other adding a little pink with the gold  theyre still attractive and neutral enough to work with your decor  my last two photos show the usual beige pattern and the previous white  gold pattern  you dont get to choose colors

i have tried another option but found these are softer and are in a smaller container and a 6 pack requires less storage so i like these better i have read complaints from others about the boxes not being made well  i did see tops on a couple of boxes in this order that werent sealed as well as usual so i gave the order an overall 4 star rating instead of 5 stars",very good,very good,very good,very good,very good
yes they are more expensive than a roll of paper towels but definitely worth it  i use it to dry my face and hands and then to clean up the sink area  they are thicker and more sturdy than paper towels and dont take up space  great for guests,very good,very good,-,-,very good

when i have small leftovers like a tomato or an onion i placed them in my gallon bags thus wasting a lot of space in the bag i saw these bags on sale at amazon and decided to test them you see ive never had any luck with plastic bags with a slider seal even if you the seal was supposedly closed it would open and couldnt seal correctly  so i figured id purchase a box of these bags prior to ordering a few of them to my surprise the slider seal actually worked and would work correctly even after opening and closing the bag a few times  if you have some smaller items and dont need gallon bags these quart bags are a great choice,-,very good,very good,very good,very good

this works very well a roll also seems to last a long time i love the spiral version because it makes pulling off the outer layer significantly easier for me with rollers that have a straight line to pull off the outer layer i end up pulling off an extra sheet or extra part of the sheet i was debating whether to take off a star for a lack of a cover but ultinately decided not to because the product is good i just really wish it came with a cover though,-,very good,very good,very good,very good

it does pick up dog hair but has a bit of difficulty with long strands of hair  the hard part is tearing off the used material and presenting a fresh new surface  takes a bit of fiddling with  i finally learned to leave the holder handle up on a table and not take the old strip off until i need to use the device again  you need expose a new strip every time you use it,-,poor,poor,-,poor
"i have two cats so im always trying to remove hair from furniture before guests arrive this roller does the job ok ill roll it across the furniture 56 times and it picks up a lot of hair but is not the stickiest roller ive ever used  it also feels like i need to peal back a new sheet a little more often than some other rollers

overall its fine and its not too hard to peal the sheets away from the roll in fact that might be its best feature  the sheets peal away on a diagonal instead of a straight across seam so the sheets dont tear where they are not supposed to",-,very good,very good,-,very good
the product is great but i dont like the spiral tear i find it more difficult to remove the used sheet than my past lint roller which had a straight tear the sheets are really sticky though and everything else is great i think its probably just personal preference,-,very good,-,-,very good

great quality that ive come to appreciate from the glad brand of trash bags favorite thing about these bags other than the color is definitely the draw string to close i primarily use in the bathrooms and under my k cup coffee maker i certainly dont want bathroom trash to fall out as i carry to the outside bin also find these bags sturdy have had no problems with them bursting i use in the small trash container i keep below my coffee center the used k cups and grounds from the espresso machine can get a bit heavier that what goes into most small trash cans but when it gets full i can gather the included draw strings and use them to lift the bag from the can the weight draws the bag closed so i can tie it off and put into the outside bin although the weight is a bit greater has never shown a sign of tearing like ive experienced with other cheaper brands ive tried also so much easier to tie close that those that are closed with a twist wire ive used this brand for years and have been very pleased with the product even though the green color did not complement my decor but the qualities evened out the problem of the color making the trash can stand out instead of blending into the background of the rooms they were used in thats why i was so happy to order the product in the blue color that blends in to my decor while providing the quality ive come to expect very pleased with my purchase and will be ordering again,very good,very good,-,very good,very good

"i bought only one box of these to test whether they really would remove pet hair from our clothes previously i had used wool dryer balls for economy and to be ecofriendly but our white cats shed fur stayed on our clothes through the wash and dry cycles and my husband was threatening mayhem

these sheets are both larger and heavier than regular dryer sheets i cant say they are perfect at removing pet hair you have to remember to turn the clothes especially including socks rightside out but compared to what we were putting up with before these are a dream im now going to put them on my subscribe and save list its that or shave the cat",-,very good,-,very good,very good
i have a jackrussle beagle mix that never stops shedding my wardrobe is mainly darker shades but her white and brown fur sticks to everything these sheets cut down by a million how much hair i have to try and brush off my clothes or pull out of my socks clean smell i even use it on our brushes for hair because it helps reduce static love them and as long as we have animals that shed and believe that darker colors are slimming i will continue to purchase these have them on auto renew thank you bounce for saving my wardrobe and sanity,-,very good,-,-,very good
i have 3 cats and 2 dogs so we were trying to find ways to get the hair off of our clothes we were having to use a lint roller to get the hairs off even after coming out of the dryer i saw this product and thought i would give it a try i guess it works great i havent noticed any pet hair on our clothes when they come out of the dryer the sheets are bigger than the ones i normally use but i put one of these in the dryer and one of my regular ones and havent had any problems glad i bought them,-,very good,-,-,very good
first off  the value before i purchase anything i check prices everywhere i got a killer deal on these bounce dryer sheets but you gotta keep checking and if you are a diehard amazon prime shopper like me you will know a deal when you see it 2 boxes of 90 count mega sheets yep mega they are huge for 699 after i applied a coupon that came with it  next is the smell  i figured if this was a pet hair remover the smell would be so so i like being proven wrong  the smell is wonderful my daughter told me she could tell when i opened the dryer door she could smell it it is so good i use them for everything now not just for help with pet hair removal ok nextthe main reason for purchase pet hair hey people hair too i know they work because i have to clean the lint trap even thru the cycle lots of hair and lint i need to order more and i think i saw a sale price so i need to reorder trust me my credentials to show i know a good hair removal dryer sheet?? 4 dogs melots of poofy floaty grey blonde hair used to be on my pillow cases and i would wake up with hairs stuck to my face not advised yuck my daughter is cuban beautiful kinky curly thick hair and lastly 2 grandkids with same hair as their mom all i can say is i never knew a dryer sheet could fight stuck on hair i am thankful i dont have to pick many hairs off my black sweaters i am not saying these sheets get 100 of hair on the clothes but pretty darn close you will definitely see a difference even the first time you use them i also used a sheet for static in my hair  my granddaughter puts sheets in her tennis shoes these bounce dryer sheets for pet hair work so well i was thinking of getting another dog a big alaskan husky only kidding i am not that crazy hmm close tho,very good,very good,very good,very good,very good

"yall i know what its like to have a full trash bag of kitchen garbage and it tears or rips while youre taking it out of the trash can  it spills all over your floorsor even worser it breaks on the way out to the street trash can and breaks spilling everything onto your driveway or grass and you have to pick it back up pouting face i also know that the price of everything has gone up and spending more  for quality trash bags just isnt in the budget it seems  cheaper to just go buy those dollar store bags that are actually more than a dollar now but in those your only getting 57 bags for a little over a dollar and i know desperate times but those are just looking like theyre a bargain theyre really not for an example say you buy a box of 5 kitchen trash bags at 125that comes to 25 cents per baga box of 7 bags about 18 cents per bagand then they wont hold a lot and of course they rip tear and just make another mess for you to clean up but now hear me outif you put in the price for these hefty brand bags you will see that for 110 bags they average 18  21 cents per bag depending on the price as of today theyre 2383 for regular purchase and 2026 on subscribe  save now if you were to buy enough of those dollar store bags to make 110 trash bags at lets say 125 per box you would have to buy 22 boxes of 5 trash bags each that would cost you 2750 or 25 cents a piece for trash bags that are thin as tissue paper
these hefty trash bags are tough
they will hold a lot of kitchen garbage they dont tear now unless you just put very sharp objects in them but it has to be something very sharp but i have put broken glass cat food cans  lids canned food cans  lids just most of whatever kitchen trash includes food scraps empty milk  egg cartons food scraps used cooking oil and these bags hold it with no leaks no breaks no spills and they are stretchy when you think theyre full inside your trash can when you take them out you can press down on the trash inside and you will see that you have room for more trash maybe leftovers from your fridge or whatever and these are odor control they have just a very light scent not overpowering at all they are also available in unscented if you prefer but why pay more for cheap dollar store bags that break  dont hold up but trick you into thinking that theyre the best buy just because theyre a little over a dollar? you actually in the long run end up paying more for the cheaply made thin trash bags than you do for these hefty bags and 110 bags will last you considerably longer than those boxes of 57 trash bags will again i know times are hard right now and were all doing the best we can to just get by with the basics and yes i know spending 2023 for trash bags seems really expensive but just look at the numbers and see that youre getting way more trash bags for your money and these are high quality trash bags on top of the price they will last you a long time and they wont let you down or leave you having to pick up trash off your floors or even worse picking up trash off your driveway or curb with all the neighbors watching  thinking “yep they didnt buy the good trash bags”
please dont let this happen to you anymore i get it i truly get itwhy spend a lot of money on trash bags because im just throwing it away? i used to think the same way exactly but i just got so tired of having to pick up the trash all over again because of the cheap tissue paper thin bags that i thought were a bargain while the makers of those cheap bags are laughing all the way to the bank now you know they dont use those cheap bags either so if you can i highly highly recommend these hefty kitchen trash bagsi have no doubt that you will be amazed at the world of difference they will make for you these are really strong sturdy stretchy trash bags and theyre drawstring  and theyre just amazing i hope that you try them and see the difference
yall have a blessed day",very good,very good,very good,very good,very good

very pretty definitely metal not plastic it was easy to stick onto my shower wall and stays on pretty well havent taken it off yet but hopefully it comes off without too much of a struggle when were ready to move even if its difficult to take off it was worth it to have an easytostore squeegee that makes my shower look more boujee,-,-,-,-,-

this is a great squeegee this is my second squeegee for the shower my first one is leaving streaks after i swipe the glass i knew it was time for another one this new one squeaks when it squeegees wiping away all that water from the shower glass it has a hole in the handle if you decide to hang it on a preexisting hook and the extra wide silicone blade means less swiping i did pick this one because of the hole in the handle i have a hook i used for the first one so of all the ones with a hole in the handle i determined this one was best overall price size and material,very good,very good,very good,-,very good

"this is a decent mop for sure the concept is great there are a couple things that could be improved which is why i left four stars

the bucket should be just a 1/2”1” taller the design now makes it so you either cant fill it to the fill line which means your mop wont totally submerge or you fill it to the fill line and water splashes out unless you go super slow which no one wants to do when in clean mode lol

the mop handle is quite short im not very tall 57 and i have to bend down to use it an adjustable handle offering more length would be awesome the handle also is prone to rust which isnt a big deal to me unless it ends up breaking i havent had it long enough to know if thatll be an issue

overall an awesome mop i have a lot of dogs and its great to have several mop heads to swap out",-,very good,-,very good,very good
ok  so i have had a cleaning business for 18 years  in the past i hated flat mops  they just seemed wasteful because you were essentially just pushing dirt around unless you rinsed and changed the mop head often  this makes it easy to rinse and squeeze the dirty water out so your not just pushing dirt around  i was very surprised at finding i approve of it  the mop heads are hard to get on correctly at first  but once you get used to doing it it gets easier  the lid on the bucket takes some time to get used to when putting it back on  you have to slide it in a slot on one side them lower the other side  but its not awful,-,good,good,-,good
"i wanted a compact and easy to use mop system that i could do walls with i had planned on making covers for an old swiffer mop but never got around to it and the big clunky restaurant style mop we thought would be great was severely unrealistic and practically unusable let alone for walls

this is super easy to use small enough that its super easy to carry around and the was and ring system works great  i got the 60” with 8 cloths and left one of the extensions off im 5 6” because i started with walls i think the extra length would have been annoying as far as managing the pole while moving around i love that you could use it super short length if you wanted i did fine washing floors at that length as well but tend to hunch over regardless

i used one cloth on some walls and to dust surfaces and used 3 others changing the water as well each time i mopped about 10 rooms/areas and our stairs  it was quick and almost enjoyable  i only vacuumed yesterday and the house had been severely neglected hair and dirt was picked up and washed away very well and it looks and feels great in here  i look forward to using this system on a regular basis its so easy to use",-,very good,very good,very good,very good
i recently purchased the joy moop and i have to say its hands down the best mop ive ever used not only is it incredibly easy to use but its also very simple to clean the mop bucket is a gamechanger  the wet side and dry side make it so easy to control the amount of water on the mop and the amount of water left on the floor no more soaking wet floors or having to wring out the mop by handthe dry side is also fantastic for picking up any remaining dust or dirt on the floor i love that i can use the joy moop for both wet and dry cleaning its truly versatileoverall i highly recommend the joy moop to anyone looking for an efficient and effective cleaning solution its made my cleaning routine so much easier and enjoyable thank you joy moop,-,very good,-,-,very good
i am one of those moppers that leaves behind a lake  having laminate floors i definitely needed a mop to wring the water out  this definitely does the job  i love that you can wring out the dirty water and it has a separation from your clean water  i do have a bit of an issue with snapping the top on  it works but it takes me time to figure it out each time i pull it out to mop  perhaps i should mop more???  i do like that the mop head is also very secure and washes up nicely  the handle feels a bit cheap but so far so good,very good,very good,very good,very good,very good

"once upon a time i worked at a mom  pop diner and i worked from opening till closing after we closed at 9pm it was my job to mop the frontend of the store my coworker swept and i had to mop think of those big yellow janitorial bucket and a big and heavy mop where you had to fill the bucket add pinesol and then squeeze with all of your might and then mop the big floor i am average female build im a bit older now so my lower back hurts and mopping isnt my cup of tea

now that i am married my husband and i share chores and hes sweet enough to do all of the vacuuming sweeping and mopping we both are working professionals and there isnt enough time to do everything we live in an pretty small apartment we have a swiffer mop that we attach the wet and dry cloth but while its okay to sweep its pretty bad at mopping ive been considering buying a household spinning mop kit but thatll take up more space in our small apartment

i ordered this mop yesterday it arrived today and set up was easy sweep the floor as best as i can use dust pan to pick up dirt or any other debris filled the bucket added some cleaning solution and mopping was a breeze for me you insert the mop it has a magnetic part on one side of the mop that is labeled ‘this way up and i can mop by myself when my husband is busy

one caveat is you have to have to insert it only one direction and it has about an inch of the mop pad not submerging in the water i do flip it around was able to dip it in and “clean” that inch and not break the mop grinning face with sweat when done i dumped the dirty water down the toilet rinsed out the bucket flipped it over to dry in the shower floor rinsed the mop and threw it in the washer

i havent yet clean my walls but when we have time to clean this weekend well definitely look forward to dusting and washing down the walls slightly smiling face

ive seen other reviewers comment about how they hate the dirty water going back in the bucket tbh do you think housekeepers or restaurant workers have separate chambers when they mop? or theyd go and change water often? its extremely common that there is only one bucket of wash water and to rinse the mop in the same bucket of water used to wash the floor those who have the time can go dump and rinse the bucket and to do a second round of mopping within your home i see it being really easy to do so with this mop system or you can fill both chambers with water and keep the dry chamber as  “clean” and the wash chamber as “dirty” water but that doesnt really utilize the ability to wring the mop dry

overall give this a try its pretty affordable lightweight and a space saver mopping is so much more convenient for me and my family",very good,very good,very good,-,very good

"i am incredibly disappointed with the flowtron bug zapper i bought it because of the product claim that the flowtron bk40d would annihilate 999 of all mosquitoes plus a ton of other bugs living in/located within/or just having the unfortunate luck of being in the full acre surrounding the flowtron we have two acres so i thought this would be the perfect weapon to fight the hordes of mosquitoes that unfortunately infiltrate our property each year i figured id get two and that would take care of our entire property how exciting hugging face however i was at least smart enough to just try one flowtron to begin with until i got a real understanding of how the thing worked and to obviously get some firsthand experience before completely falling for the hype i should also mention that this zapper also promised some other “togoodtobetrue type things but they mostly relied on purchasing some other accessories before theyd be proven to be true or more likely disappoint the masses however i decided to just stick with the basic mosquito massacre model so i went on amazon and ordered the flowtron bk40d based on everything i read about this machine i truly believed i was in for nothing short of a miracle but boy was i wrong not only was it pretty much identical to every other mosquito zapping machine ive ever seen/owned but the thing came with some pack of liquid or something to stick on the machine in order to attract a cult of koolaid drinking bunnies or something like thatoh wait now that i think about it i think it was actually for getting giant jumping spiders to commit suicide not even joking about that one i mean not really   or at least not specifically for euthanizing charlotte and her chubby family members but i promise you it did come with a packet meant to do some sort of major damage to some type of living creature but unfortunately the instructions i received about attaching the packet slash using the original product as intended were so incredibly hard to comprehend i had to eventually give up and theres even more to this tragedyplot twist how exciting right?? not rightthe stupid thing broke within a couple of weeks and on top of that yes theres more i made sure to study the machines success each and every day to do this one must look at the zapper with ones own eyes and determine whether or not the zapper is actually zapping a pile of bugs underneath the machine and pieces of crusty wing stuck to the machine are exactly the kind of evidence youd be needing as proof that the zapper is zapping so anyway each morning id go out expecting to see evidence that the machine was working and doing the job it had been given and each day id pass by the zapper with a familiar pang of disappointment no piles of dead mosquitoesno collage of crusty wrinkled wings just a flowtron bk40d hanging there and mocking the excitement i once had that wed “finally get a handle on that annoying mosquito problem” just like our daughters pool cowering in the background green with algae mocks the excitement our children once had to play in the 81892 square feet of what was once our yard but during spring and summer months it is better known as the bordello of sucking blood and the house of encephalitis malaria and ill repute aka the 81892 square foot breeding ground for one of the most annoying and vile creatures god could have ever allowed on planet earth but i digress as i was saying the flowtron was not living up to the promises it made about killing all the mosquitoes within a one mile radius let alone killing the ones hanging around our back porch it was pathetic i mean i literally watched a mosquito fly around the flowtron and then stop and land on it and i swear i saw that thing laughing hysterically and flipping me off just taking a break on what was supposed to be the literal depiction of a mosquito killing machineyet here it is just hanging there available to these freaking mosquitoes for their rest and relaxation whenever they just want to take a breather ya know?? i mean cmon at that point i was just about at the last straw if you willand then it happened i wanna say this was maybe two and a half maybe three weeks after i shelled out the what maybe 50 60 or something like that to buy what i thought was going to be our miracle solution the flowtron bk40dand the damn thing broke i kid you not thats right 60 3 weeks after buying it it freaking broke something electrical that only a specialist can fix this machine that was a yes i know “zapper“ was still supposed to be the topoftheline bestinitsclass cant get any better 1 ever made bug zapper specializing in the supposedly humane method of exterminating mosquitoes and it broke after three weeks the light turned to a faint purple when it was plugged in and it was no longer able to injure mame or kill any bug of any kind i called the number on the website and no one was able to help me i could try to have them replace it but they wanted me to pay for the new one up front and then send them back the “old one” though in my mind 3 weeks will never in any way be considered “old” if the problem with the “old one” isnt covered under the very very extremely limited warranty then i am stuck with having to pay 60 for each zapper 120 total but if the problem is covered under the very very limited warranty then i would get a refund of the 60 i just paid for the replacement zapper

after receiving this explanation as basically my only option unless i wanted to go to a private electrician mechanic or engineer to fix whatever the problem was with the original and then pay them whatever their fee is to fix ityeah right so basically i realized that this was just going to be a loseloselose situation for me id lose my money id lose the zapper and id lose my mind so i figured id just stick with the l/l/l plan basically because its the cheapest option and i didnt feel like being ripped off by anyone else so basically the zapper flowtron bk40d sucks ass the company who makes/sells it and provides the customer service on the worst warranty in history sucks ass but most of all mosquitoes suck major ass so i 100 would not recommend you buy the flowtron bk40d unless you feel like getting ripped off or if you have some weird fetish for being ripped off and its cheaper to buy the flowtron than some weirdly specific prostitute then i would say to go ahead and steer clear of buying this crappy machine now or in the future unless they make a version in say 20 years that doesnt suck ass but i think we all know thats not very likely so what im saying is i bought this product it sucks ass i 100 do not recommend the flowtron bk40d i am giving this product 1 star oh yeah and mosquitoes suck ass too thanks for reading my review have a wonderful day",bad,bad,-,bad,bad
"i live at the edge between a full square mile of farmland and suburbia  so lots of bugs of the flying variety i also have a problem with wasps i have been a live and let live kind of person until one year i was stung on 3 different occasions multiple times by one wasp each time ive been on a war path with these creatures ever since usually soaking nests when found with raid wasp spray which works great just the can is always about 1oz too shy  anyhow i read that wasps are photowhateverthey like bug zapper lights quick read this one gets top reviews

i can see why the first few nights were windy oklahoma so not a lot of action but woke up to find a wasp carcass attached to the inside grid sweet another night another carcass finally got a still night and watched some fireworks a bit of time passes i was outside grilling and one of the hotspots for wasps was void of any banged on the wall next to this spot and none came out w00t

now i still leave it on why? i dont care for bugs sure we have birds in the area but not enough it seems same with bats and again none of them seem to eat up the wasps

earlier tonight i cooked up a bunch of brats on the grill now that its dusk that zapper wont go more than half a second before getting multiple hits its awesome no idea what its taking out but it works and ive yet to use the bait that comes with it",-,good,good,-,good
holy crap is all i have to say for this this was literally 1 night of being used and not even the full night because it was scaring our dogs from going outside to go potty probably between the two mountains of mosquitos and what i had scraped off of the light was anywhere between 5001000 mosquitos i would do the recommended thing next time and place it 25 feet away because they tend to flock near and rest on places near the light also keep your lights off at first to attract them to the light i didnt even peal open the mosquito attractant and the my swarmed after the sun went down 100 would recommend i only hope that its water proof/resistant so if it rains or some sprinklers hit it it doesnt ruin it also would recommend buying a switch plug so you can just turn it on with a flip of a switch rather than pulling the cable out of the outlet every time you turn it off and on so you dont damage the outlet,-,very good,very good,-,very good

they come out of the box easily but you can rip the bag if you are not careful when separating  bags from the perforation  i have had bags wet and leak at the bottom  not sure that is because the contents were disintegrating through the bag or what but i learned not to let the bag linger in my stainless steel container too long  also sharp items like egg shells can rip the bag so i place shells on top of something like my coffee grounds or tea bags these bags do the job  shipping is quick and product came in perfect condition,-,very good,very good,very good,very good

after reading the reviews about issues with leaking which are true i came up with a system that worked for me i saved a day or two of veggie scraps at a time not letting them stay out long enough for the bag to deteriorate i put the bags in my freezer until i had a sizable amount then when i cleaned my chicken coop i took the bags out ripped them open and threw everything in my compost heap i made a nice hot pile and when i gave it a first turn i only found one tiny scrap of bag which will invariably break down in this next turn very pleased that the bags actually break down in a hot compost pile makes saving scraps much easier and rewarding,-,very good,very good,-,very good

"none of them 10 out of 10
1 rinse clean mop 
 rinsing mop in clean water every time
 mop base is clicking at least mine
 handle is not extandable you need to unscrew 3 parts in order to store in in the bucket
 bucket with fresh water is not big enough so i ending up with refilling it at least once
 most expensive from all 3
2 microfiber spay mop
 no bucket less storage
 sprays pretty wide and far enough
 you not rinsing mop just adding water on the floor
 you need to refill quite often
 if you will loose a little rubber part from you dispenser it will start leak so you need brand new mop

"so i bought this for glasses because i have never used a brush like this for dishes only flashes that i cant reach the bottom

but then i bought a george foreman grill and that all changed this and some hot water make all of the cleaning of cooked on meat so easy to remove without scratching the nonstick surface it also is easy to clean off the debris afterwards from this brush same goes for anything else that sticks to dishes and pans

almost all of my pans are teflon so i am not trying to ruin them as long as i dont use this brush dry on anything i am not hurting any of them thank goodness for the other reviewer that pointed out a great use for this to clean off crud i think for her it was spaghetti and sauce

ive put off buying a machine like this because i doubted it would really do the job i kept wishing there was an easier way to scrub the shower without getting a backache and muscle cramps so there was a list that i found on google of the best cordless extendedlength scrubbers and this brand was on the list it had a great review and the price wasnt bad so i took the plunge i have to say that im quite pleased it has enough length to reach and easily interchangeable brushes it isnt very heavy i was able to clean my shower in less than 1/2 hour and i gave it a good scrubbing the shower floor is fiberglass and it really gets dingy i also did the walls and recesses the brushes are round so they work pretty well in corners this machine is powerful and i still had plenty of charge when i finished so far ive only done the shower but i can think of lots of other uses theres one brush that by the shape looks like it might be for the toilet bowl ive already decided that im not going to put it in the toilet but ill find something to use it for the bottom line is i like the machine and i feel that the price is a good value,very good,very good,-,-,very good
i found this product a while back but hesitated to buy it because i wasnt sure if i would use it or if i was taking the lazy cheaper way of deep cleaning our shower ive used it once now and am excited to use it again i just used baking soda and soap on our tile shower and after using this to scrub it it left it feeling so clean assembly wasnt difficult its pretty easy to carry i will say even though i wasnt scrubbing myself i did break a sweat from using the brush to clean the tub walls but not nearly as much as i would have if i was scrubbing on my own overall im quite satisfied with this purchase and regret not buying this sooner,very good,very good,-,-,very good
we were looking at replacing our tile floor because the grout was super dirty and the titles never looked clean i did the foyer but left the dining room for comparison and wow just wow night and day difference we are cleaning our hot tub this weekend with a softer head and i am very hopeful it gets rid of the calcium build up the only negative is the handle is fairly short about 4 door if i had to guess so it is a bit hard on the back sure beats a scrub brush on hands and knees not that i ever did that and now i will never need to,-,very good,-,-,very good
"i often use my 3rd bedroom and bathroom as an airbnb  i have a cleaning lady who comes between guests but if im home i often help  i particularly focus on the bathroom and mostly the shower

i think all my guests are entitled to a germfree shower  but i have a bad back so scrubbing the walls and the rest of the shower is difficult

this has made the job a lot easier  the doesnt require a lot of pressure it cleans thoroughly you can see exactly where youve cleaned and its lightweight

first lets talk about the positives the plushness and absorbency are topnotch its a real treat for your tush and the 3 cushionysoft layers really do pamper you the 18 mega rolls pack is also quite convenient as each roll is equal to 4 regular rolls this means less frequent roll changes and fewer trips to the store so far so good

however there is one drawback that might be a dealbreaker for some the width of the toilet paper it seems quilted northern has decided to cut down the width a bit and its noticeable you might find yourself using more tp than before which is a bit of a bummer but in my opinion the overall quality and comfort still outweigh this issue

in conclusion quilted northern ultra plush toilet paper is a fantastic option for those looking for a softer more absorbent bath tissue the width might be a tad disappointing but the luxury and convenience of this product still make it well worth the investment and hey who doesnt want to pamper their behind?",-,very good,-,-,very good
sorry shoppers but there will be no images or video lol anyway i think this is the cadillac of all tps out there some others have those fibers fly up in the air when you rip off some this could be thicker but it is my favorite i dont buy the cheap stuff i dont like any of the other name brands,good,-,-,-,good
the toilet paper is of good quality and thickness my only gripe has been with delivery i dont know if it is the fault of the manufacturer or amazon ive ordered this product many times and have had it set to automatic delivery four out of the five times ive ordered there has been problems out of stock missing or amazon telling me its been delivered when it hasnt and then telling me it was accidentally punched as delivered that has happened twice i bought a ring camera just because of these problems i guess its worked out for amazon as they managed to get more money out of me anyway quality is great as i stated just more difficult to get delivered than it should be,poor,poor,poor,-,poor
"i recently missed my bimonthly delivery because of a mixup on my part so i went to my local store and purchased a different name brand starts with sc bath tissue that was on sale good price and i had a coupon on top of it name brand awful starts with sc never ever again will i make the same mistake its supposed to be soft and strong but was so thin and harsh it hurt my nose my lady bits and other parts and fell apart in normal use
lesson learned  quilted northern tissue is by far superior to the other name brand it is soft on my lady bits holds together very well for all other tasks including nose blowing it might be a tad more expensive but to me the far superior quality softness and durability is well worth it as soon as i figured out my error on my bimonthly shipment i immediately placed a replacement order i am so glad i did never again will i buy any other product no i am not being paid for this review it is my honest opinion as well as the opinion of the other adult in the household quilted northern it is",very good,very good,very good,-,very good
this is my hubbys favorite toilet paper it is the only one he will use he says that he likes it because it is strong and absorbent the truth is he likes it because it is super soft and gentle on his sensitive tush during toilet paper shortage he was distraught because any of the toilet paper available was not working for him when my brother came to visit from germany and he used this super soft quilted northern toilet paper he was aghast because it was too soft for his manly man german butt luckily we still had some sanding paper from the pandemic ahem other brand toilet paper left over so my brother could use that which was a winwin for my husband because now the other man in the house wasnt using his beloved softysoft toilet paper so if prefer a swedish massage over a deep tissue massage this toilet paper is for you,-,very good,-,-,very good

im not sure i understand why this product got so much hype i didnt really notice any difference from my usually cleaners it did have a nice simple smell that wasnt too overwhelming but it def didnt do anything magical i guess i was expecting miracles with my muscle work i put into scrubbing,-,neutral,-,-,neutral
i bought this with not much hope ive been using many different other cleaners on my shower over the years that either didnt work smelled so strong i got lightheaded and headaches or worseboth i had soap scum stains that i havent been able to get off for the last 7 years that were starting to turn black i wanted something that i could spray on let sit scrub little and rinse i was dreaming i knew that who knew that my dreams would come true? this stuff is amazing it foamed nicely still ran a little but didnt hinder the effect and smelled yummy i love rhubarb and that is what it smells like it did not smell like cleaner to me at all and wasnt strong i let it sit for about 8 minutes quickly scrubbed with a brush and rinsed there were still some spots that i resprayed and let sit for 10 min i was so excited to rinse that second time i called my husband in to look i was so excited he was amazed face with hand over mouth my 10 and 6 yo thought i was crazy when i called them in to see face with tongue i went and ordered another bottle right away get this i beg of you sparkling heart,-,very good,very good,very good,very good
i will start by saying this is a great cleaning product for certain things it cleaned our grimy faucets beautifully but we bought this intentionally to try to help us remove a hard water stain on black tile that weve been trying to remove since we purchased the house weve tried every cleaner in every store it seems like and even many home remedies but have still not found a product to remove the hard water stain love the easy to use spray bottle and how accessible this product is in bigger stores,-,very good,-,very good,very good
this item is fantastic couldnt wait to try it out on my bathtub with a lot of soap scum build up many years in the making had tried bleach and other products bleach was too harsh and strong odor however this product i sprayed it on use a sponge with a lite abrasiveness and the soap scum came off this saved me a ton of money no more need to reglaze tub,very good,very good,-,-,very good
"cleaned a tub stain that i had tried about 15 different products to try to get it out  we bought a house and are slowly remodeling it
 there was an ugly stain in the tub and we are not doing the bathroom until summer but that stain bugged me to no end  tried several products and home remedies but this is the only thing that worked  put it on and let it set on a paper towel forabout an hour  came back and the stain was gone  upset i did not take before and after pics but i  didnt expect much since i had already tried so many things  will definitely buy again",-,poor,-,-,poor
was looking forward to a fantastic cleaning solutionwas certainly mediocre  you can purchase this at walmart or target for the same price wasnt too impressed,good,-,-,-,good

"so im already a fan of the swiffer  it gets the job done but this past year was a very dusty and dry one so im chasing tons of cobwebs and dust up high on my ceiling fans  i figure this set is no different than the regular swiffer just has a long handle — exactly what i needed

what i wasnt prepared for was how superior and fluffy these swiffer fluffs really are  they are like the normal ones but on steroids  what should have been a very long session over a week of spring house cleaning the house took less than a day  fans computer screens back of the tv and game consoles the china cabinet the corners and the trim and mounding — everything is so much cleaner  best of all?  these fit a regular swiffer handle so i can clean faster everywhere now while we try to get rid of the crazy amounts of dust last summer and fall brought in

"i bought these on a whim my child refuses to fork out the money to buy rechargeable video game controllers she ran through batteries constantly the last time she needed batteries we were out of them im on a tight budget so buying big name batteries even at the yellow dollar store is out of the question as often as she needs them

i came to amazon and found these i figured even if they were not ideal and were more along the lines of the generic ones at the leafy green dollar store theyd still be a better deal for the amount you receive

they come in a small box and plastic wrapped in groups of four i gave her a fourpack i cant remember when i bought these i forgot to look at the date before i started writing the review at any rate she didnt come back for another pack until a 3 or 4 days ago she said wow these lasted a lot longer than i thought they would i agree

my only use for batteries is in remote controls so she goes through 5x as many as i ever do ive not needed to use them so far myself when i do ill update my review if i have a different experience for what i am buying them for theyre definitely a keeper",very good,very good,very good,very good,very good
there are a lot of batteries in the box but ive only used one so far the electrons seem to be flowing freely with no clogs in the electrical pathways i cant perfectly attest to that because those darn electrons are so small my old eyes are failing and all the pathways are concealed anyways the mouse i put it in claims it should last a year get back to me for updates they dont seem to have a remote control ability,-,bad,-,bad,bad

with an ever increasing demand you can never have enough batteries with everything from flashlights security cameras smoke detectors co2 detectors and of course remote controls you will probably need to reorder long before the 10 year life guarantee expires the price was great and the delivery was next day with prime who can be unhappy with service like this,very good,very good,very good,-,very good
ive purchased these numerous times and have compared them to duracell most recently in led candles  they both lasted the same amount of time so why pay more for the latter??  the box of 100 count came packed in 2 cardboard boxes of 50 each so packaging is recyclable with no plastic  i highly recommend these batteries,-,-,neutral,neutral,neutral

i live in nj which has terribly hard water that will permanently ruin your dishes and glasses via a process known as etching it doesnt matter what dishwasher detergent you use i actually use a finish detergent too but this liquid rinse aid is required if you want to save your dishes if you see any cloudy residue on your dishes/glasses chances are its hard water mineral deposits over time these minerals etch your dishes and that look becomes permanent i learned all this after moving to nj and all my dishes and glasses being ruined as long as you keep your rinse aid reservoir full of finish youll be good to goif you have residue on your dishes now hand wash with liquid dishwasher detergent and hand dry then add finish to your dishwasher and it shouldnt come back hopefully your dishes arent too far damagedthere is no substitute for this product im never without it,-,very good,very good,-,very good

"this is by far the best lint remover ive used and i have tried sooooo many i use it mostly for pet hair i have 2 dogs and i hate the hair love the dogs
at first they were just ok but then i started rolling slower and i can pick up most of the hair in 1 roll so i thought omg ive never used them right so i went and got my old brand and tried rolling slower and it didnt matter they cant compete with your brand
the only thing i wish is there was an easier why to pull off the roll but none of them is easy and id rather that issue and better hair removal anyway kudos
i dont know how to take the screenshot and get the order numberits not on the review page",-,very good,-,-,very good
i bought these because some basic lint rollers i bought from the store were just not cutting it and boy do these do the job i have a long haired dog and she gets her glitter all over me before i leave the house and it is particularly gross and noticeable if wearing black i keep one of these upstairs downstairs and in my car they are so effective ive started to use it on furniture too you will not be disappointed by these,-,good,-,-,good

i was skeptical about trying yet another product that claimed to remove pet hair from clothing but i am so glad i gave these lint rollers a chance they really do an excellent job of picking up pet hair from all types of fabrics even those that are notoriously difficult to clean i have a cat that sheds a lot and these lint rollers have been a lifesaver the sheets are sticky enough to get every last hair but not so sticky that they damage the fabric or leave any residue i would highly recommend these lint rollers to anyone who struggles with pet hair on their clothes or furniture theyre definitely worth the investment and have made my life a lot easier,-,very good,-,-,very good
pet hair gone i am and animal lover and unfortunately they shed these extra sticky lint rollers make the loose hair disappear quickly with one swipe,-,poor,-,-,poor

"i bought a few of the swiffer duster sets for the handles some came with the 180 duster and some with the 360 duster both dusters will work with any of the handles the difference between the two dusters is that the 360 duster holds a lot more dust than the 180 but both have a purpose

this set comes with the 360 duster refills and a handle that extends 3 feet and also flexes to a 90 degree angle at the end of the duster although the handle is shorter when not extended it is not as short as the handle that comes with some of the other sets for some jobs i find the shorter handle easier to use

i am 51 and i can easily dust the fan blades on the many fans we have in our house this set also works great to clean the cold air returns usually placed near the ceiling in addition i have used this duster to remove dust webs on ceilings and in the corners where the ceiling and wall meet in addition the dust can easily be removed from behind bookcases and entertainment centers that cant be moved to vacuum im sure i havent covered all the uses for this dust but im sure you got my point this duster can remove dust from places that cant be reached with a dust rag or a vacuum

i hope this review was helpful for you",-,very good,-,very good,very good
i love the swiffer line of products i use my swiffer duster for blinds trimwork and ceiling fans it makes dusting a lot easier with the lengthy attachment to reach the higher areas that tend to collect dust the dust clings to the duster and makes dusting so much easier than pulling around a vacuum  this is my second one the only reason i had to replace my first one is because my husband stepped on the first one and broke it in half,-,very good,-,-,very good
i love how far it extends also how good the cloth part collects dust the part where the wand slides into is easy to find there is no guess work on where does the two tongs slide in it has a bendable end made for places that are not straight and also for blinds it fold up nice for storage as well it also has a hook on the end for hanging purposes the mechanical parts of extending works nice and easy i recommend the starter kit for anyone first buying it it comes with the wand and the cloth ends the price is very good as well,very good,very good,-,-,very good
love this product easy to use duster helps keep dust away and allergies under control,-,very good,-,-,very good
im only using this on a shiny ebony digital piano but before i got these dusting that thing was a pain and left streaks from the damp paper towels i had been using now its not only faster but i think theyre doing a better job and its a lot less frustrating,-,-,-,-,-
the swiffer duster is amazing  everyone should have one honestly you can get into and on top of every space and practically every single little crevice it doesnt brush/shake off the dust you just dusted like any other duster which is an extra plus for people with allergies like me and just for your health in general highly recommend smiling facethumbs up,-,-,-,-,-
this is my 3 set i have very high ceilings and shaker wood all through my house and this makes my life easier and great for my ceiling fans and the shandilers,-,very good,-,-,very good
what more is there to say it grabs the dust and doesnt just move it around into a pile,-,-,-,-,-

scouring side is effective for deep cleaning
dries reasonably fast
comes in different colors so you can use a different color for different task kitchen bathroom etc

"per the instructions  which i was not aware of until the bottle arrived to me and i went to go use it for the first time  you have to use like 152 capfuls for one load of laundry i think thats ridiculous considering how small the bottle is and how much it costs

i will probably buy it again but ill probably use less per load than what the bottle recommends because i think that would still get the job done and would save me money

i like that the product doesnt smell overwhelmingly strong like bleach and doesnt leave a strong odor on the clothes either it does definitely have an odor though when you open the bottle but its just enough to make feel like its going to sanitize the laundry you can also smell a slight odor of it when you open the washing machine after the load of wash is done and the garments are wet/damp but it doesnt remain when the clothes have dried

additionally i have sensitive skin my skin does not tolerate scented lotions well some scented detergents make me itchy and sometimes i just cant tolerate perfumes in laundry products and it sets off my allergic rhinitis symptoms coughing sneezing itchy eyes i did not find using this product on my towels or clothes to cause any negative reactions with my skin or my allergies",neutral,neutral,neutral,neutral,neutral
"at first when i saw this i dont know what i thought  i honestly thought it was some way to capitalize on covid honestly  im sure it existed before that but had not heard of it before  i was like are we really sanitizing our laundry now???  lol

but  let me tell you any funk smell thats clinging to your clothes from past issues  this will get rid of those lingering smells  for example if you wash towels and leave them sitting in the washer overnight because you forgot to switch them over to the dryer before bed they smell sour no matter how freshly washed they are  they might smell clean until you go to dry yourself off again and the towel absorbs some moisture  as soon as its damp that sour smell is back  its just really gross  i dont know how many towels that have becoming cleaning rags because of this issue

now i put some of this sanitizer in one of those downey fabric softener balls and another ball with my softener  my clothes are always fresh and clean now with no lingering stenches  i subscribed and have 2 of these sitting on my laundry room shelf  i encourage you to try it at least once",-,-,very good,-,very good

"my wife and i set out to find a steam cleaner to clean spots and high traffic areas on our carpets  after seeing a video review of one of the portable models on facebook we decided on this model
pros and cons
the first thing i discovered is that this model is not a steam cleaner had i read the product description more carefully i would have realized that so i was skeptical about how well it would work the first thing we cleaned was a three year old sofa in the family room room with no visible signs of soil after filling the tank with hot water and the very small amount of cleaning fluid required we went to work man oh man after going over the couch the water in the tank was brown and disgusting we had no idea it was that dirty
next we tackled the beige carpet in front of the couch this area was visibly soiled from foot traffic and food spills  using the deep clean attachment we cleaned an area about 4 feet by 8 feet the bissell removed all the stains and made the carpet look brand new
same results on the stairs and landings
i have to look hard to find any cons  one might be that it cleans so well youll wish you could tackle large areas  but its truly a portable cleaner for relatively small areas  if you want to clean all your carpets this is not the best choice  also it has a nice long electrical cord but the hose could be a bit longer you tend to have to move the unit a lot because the hose is short
but if you are looking for a great portable cleaner to use in the car or around the house you wont be disappointed in this model",-,very good,-,very good,very good
this little machine is a must have especially if you have pets it has impressive cleaning and suction power i had cat urine in my fabric car seats that i could not get out manually i bought this because the price was very reasonable given the other choice would be to rent something the odor and previous existing stains came out easily and the seats dried out within 2 days 80 degree dry spring day they look better than when i bought the car used while i havent used it yet on rugs or furniture i am convinced it will be able to tackle the job i highly recommend this item,very good,very good,-,-,very good
this thing works very well at getting stains out i use it for home furnishings and automobile interiors the sample bottles of shampoo will last for about 4 uses each do your research to determine which shampoo you will need a pretreatment spray makes crusty stains easy to conquer it even removed a small inkjet printer ink stain that i thought was permanent unfortunately i always have too much shampoo solution left over  but i would rather have to much than not enough also it is pretty loud during use,-,very good,-,very good,very good
ok this bissell is by far the best of its kind this has a 57 amp compared to the green spot this model also comes with the extra deep clean head with silicone comb i have a guest mattress that had a cup of cocoa spilled on it about 2 christmass ago i used the little green spot first gen and all it did was lighten the stain this model is a definite level up and took the stain right out with minimal effort i pretreated with hydrogen peroxide and used “the pink stuff”floor cleaner in the bot and the pictures speak for themselves im obsessed with this little powerhouse i moved on to a vintage queen anne chair sofa set i have and wondered what i could get out yall the arms of the chairs looked pretty clean but alas this lil sucker pulled out decades of dirt  grime the water was literally black i was truly astonished im so thankful for this machine and and so happy bissell hit it out of the park with this machine i did a few hours of research on bissells products and concluded this model would fit my needs its totally did,-,very good,-,-,very good
"i bought the bissell little green pro to use on our furniture upholstery i received it and used it yesterday ill update this review if anything changes but there was one key items that i couldnt find in questions and reviews that i wanted to mention so that first 
when i filled the clean tank where you put the water and cleaning solution water wash leaking significantly out the bottom connection i couldnt tighten the connection so just put it on the machine as quickly as possible what i discovered later was the threads were opposite what i expected  so instead of righty tighty lefty loosey it was lefty tighty turn left to tighten the connection
as far as cleaning i used the bissell professional pet urine eliminator  oxy to clean the couch seats the machine and solution worked really well  good clean with mild pleasant scent which went away fairly quickly  i did have to use the suction multiple times to get out as much as possible from the upholstery
overall very happy to have this little machine instead of having to pay for professional cleaners on repeated occasions  we have dogs and cats so repeated occasions does happen",-,very good,very good,very good,very good
"this little vacuum is awesome we have a mix of rugs and theyve gone in the washing machine been spot cleaned but nothing was getting those tough stains out within just a couple minutes this little machine got rid of those stains

its easy to use and comes with 2 attachments and 2 little sample bottles
setting up takes just a minute pour water into the tank pour the cleaner and the antibacterial agents plug in and youre good to go

the suction power is good its not wow amazing it takes some patience using this as it took a few extra passes/sprays to get out those tougher/deeper stains but it did get them all my tips are to work small areas at a time and dont overspray the water",-,very good,very good,very good,very good
i have a new house and coffee got spilled on the living room carpet after living here only a couple of months i tried to get the spot out unsuccessfully i then called a professional carpet shampooing service and had them come and clean the carpet the spot was still visible i then decided to give this little machine a try i even bravely bought an amazon warehouse model that was listed as used i figured someone ordered it and then cleaned up something nasty and returned it was pleasantly surprised to find a pristine model even the two trial bottles of cleaner were still sealed the coffee stain is gone,-,very good,-,very good,very good

i havent seen this solid air freshener since the 70s it seemed like everyone had 1 on the back of their toilets i didnt know that it was still being made i originally bought it out of curiosity and because of its low price i like the scent and the fact that you can control the strength of the scent by how much you open or close the top im not particularly thrilled with the fact that it looks like an air freshener but i do keep it in my entryway stashed out of sight it does a good job of continuously leaving my entryway smelling nice and fresh i do recommend this air freshener for smaller areas i dont have a clue as to whether or not itd work in larger areas its a nice inexpensive and convenient way to keep my entryway smelling fresh i will continue to buy it as long as the price remains budget friendly",very good,very good,-,-,very good

we have been long time users of the scotch blue kitchen sponges with scrubber as its always on sale and available at costco  saw that americas test kitchen recommended this one as their preferred sponge so thought we would give it a try and it has now become our new favorite  the scotch blue have gotten thinner and thinner with new iterations so it doesnt hold as much water  also the adhesive holding the scrubber on the blue sponges seem to peel off with certain ones  with this sponge its thick and holds a lot of water/soap and have not had a problem yet with the scrubber detaching from the sponge  this is our new kitchen sponge from now on,very good,very good,very good,-,very good

the concept behind the mop is great it was simple and easy to use i was able to mop my living dining and kitchen areas roughly 700 sqft  in about 15 minutes which is a huge plus

the spinner is genius i have hardwood floors and the spinner removed just enough water to protect my floors while still getting a good clean it made mopping kinda fun and the bucket was easy to rinse out

its lightweight which is great however i feel that because its so lightweight some of the structural integrity is gone for instance the mop head would detach from the handle periodically from the weight of the head once wet because the handle couldnt screw in tight enough without stripping the plastic not a major issue if you dont mind tightening it every once in a while

i also love that the mop “refills” are machine washable giving you a clean start every time

overall the mop is fantastic for the price and i would recommend it to anyone",very good,very good,very good,-,very good
"mop/bucket delivers as portrayed in the video/pictures i was impressed with how fast the spindry works realistically i believe that about 95 of the dirty water is centrifugally removed on the very first spin but i could not resist giving the mop head a few more twirls just because its cool to watch and feel the mop handle twirl in your hand

the only negative things i have to say about the mop/bucket system are

i wish the mop head were larger meaning the mop tassels are only about 4 inches long making the overall footprint of the mop head 1112 inches wide at best if totally stretched out flat which is never the case realistically the mop head really only covers about 89 inches in diameter since it bunches up during use

pushing down on the foot pedal hurts your foot if barefooted i found it less painful to press down the pedal approaching it from the side of the bucket rather than the direct toes in first approach

"as a pet owner i know firsthand how frustrating it can be to deal with pet hair on clothing and furniture the scotchbrite lint roller has been a game changer for me and im so glad i discovered it

the lint roller works great on pet hair and other lint and it picks it up quickly and easily the 95 sheets per roll also last a long time so you wont need to replace it too often

the compact size of the lint roller makes it easy to carry with you onthego and the adhesive is strong enough to pick up even the smallest hairs i also appreciate that the handle is made from 100 recycled plastic

"i used this on a 17 year old buick it is in pretty good shape we dont use it that much with about 100 thousand miles anyway the newer cars get the garage and this one is mainly in the driveway so it gets a lot of sun well my area doesnt seem to get too much warm weather the way it is facing it really only gets morning sun but i worried that it would really take a toll on the leather seats

they arent cracked or faded but are looking a little creased in places i cleaned them really well first with a detergent i used fantastic spray because it seems to be the best cleaner i have used to get off any oily films like on my ceramic fireplace surround on stoves etc it was probably a little harsher than many cleaners but i dont think these seats have been really cleaned in many years to me leather is like skin if i would use it on my skin i dont fear it with leather i have used saddle soaps and i used to clean my leather sofa with dove bar soap it worked super well but i needed more aggressive cleaning here i think dawn dish soap would also work but i wanted less water since i wanted to condition soon after cleaning and not wait a day or so after the soap and water

so seats are clean and ready i noticed that the headrests and the sides and backs of the front seats looked like a different texture i wondered if they were not genuine leather actually being some sort of vinyl or some sort of bonded leather

bonded leather is really ground up bits of leather and other plastics then the mixture is pressed to a backing and then sealed with something i mean technically there is some leather ingredients but if you ever had an office chair where the leather peeled off in bits you know it isnt really like leather still if you are gentle with it and dont expect it to be like split leather or hide then it is fine

anyway i did not use this product on those areas i kept it to the places where the leather felt like supple and had the deeper markings of the skin i used",-,very good,-,-,very good
"on the vinyl and other plastics in the car i got the 8oz bottle because i wasnt sure i would like it  the bottle was sealed with a big piece of tape i guess to prevent the product from leaking except when i tried to peel it off it ripped the entire front label off of the bottle luckily i had peel the back more carefully so i still had the directions it is simple though wipe on  wipe offso i am sure i could have figured it out

it is clear in color and came out of the bottle in a viscous fashion like corn syrup or glycerin thick and sticky that was my nickname in high school ha ha just kidding it wasnt easy to put on initially i poured some on my microfiber cloth and tried to rub it into my seat well it like got stuck not like glue but you really had to pull to move the product around the next swipe i poured it on my cloth and sort of dotted the product around a larger area then rubbed it in to make an even coating by dotting it around i wasnt trying to smear a puddle of the stuff but move smaller dabs of it that worked much better after you sort of have it moved to a generally even coating it is easier to rub the whole area again to get it to be like a film over the whole thing then you are supposed to let it sit for up to a day and wipe off the excess

the next day i was a little nervous that i would go out there and the product would be like sticky paint it looked shinyish like nothing had penetrated at all i envisioned my rag skipping and dragging over the stuff to remove the excess and i was ready to give my hands and arms a real workout to buff this stuff off to my happy surprise i didnt have much of any excess at all there was a corner or two where i didnt get it spread as thinly where i could feel my rag catch but it was only about a square inch at at time it was no longer sticky the leather was really nice and shiny and i really still thought it was the leftover product maybe it changed to like a greasy/oily residue but i kept trying to wipe it off as i didnt want it on our clothes but nothing on my rag i even ran my hand over it with pretty good pressure to see if my hand was shiny afterwards but it was not

i am really happy with the way the seats came out i am hoping that the conditioning treatment will help me keep the seats cleaner now as they are more smooth and dirt will be easier to remove with a just a damp microfiber or super mild soap next time i might want to do this on a warmer day it was in the 50s in the shade when i did it to see if the warmer product would be easier to spread i see that others have warmed their bottles but i was into a big entire detailing project with carpet extractions and steaming and everything and just didnt feel like stopping to warm it when i was finally at this step i did this last because i didnt want to be crawling all over the car to clean window and stuff after i applied it

sorry for the long review but i try to tell everyone my whole experience with using the product my recommendations are 1 first clean your stuff first as much as you can you dont want to seal in dirt i wasnt insane with this step just clean it 2 possibly warm the bottle in warm water or sun i didnt do this and it was fine 3 dot it around to make it easier to get an even coat i made mine thin like a film not a coating sort of like putting lotion on your skin you dont paint it on you put a film on it will still feel sticky if you put your finger on it though 4 then wipe the next day i am sure the absorption rate varies based on how dry your leather is the warmth in the room etc i did not need additional coats maybe for something very dry you may i wouldnt try a heavy single coat you are just gonna waste it if you are wiping off goo if it still isnt nice try another coat and see if it will absorb if not you may have to wait a few weeks for it to penetrate more deeply",-,very good,very good,very good,very good
"the result of using this product are beautiful leather couches that look refreshed the process was a bit tricky however the product is thick you can use warm water to heat it up to make it more viscous my first time using it the product was at room temperature and i used a microfiber cloth the product would not spread i could not spread the product as the product/cloth was pulling the leather every direction i ended up scrapping the cloth and using my hands which worked a lot better

the second time i used it i warmed up the product and just used my hands right off it worked but i think i could have heated up the product more

using your hands works but its hard with a lot of surface area

the day after using the product or a few hours after you are supposed to wipe up any excess this was also difficult because once again the leather couch was pulled by the cloth with some effort i was able to complete it

the application process made me want to give this 4 stars vs 5 but i am thinking it may have been some user error will keep trying different options",-,poor,poor,-,poor
"update 5/26/2022  it has now been a few weeks since i applied the conditioner the slight sticky feeling that was still on the couch sofa is gone now it has either soaked in or evaporated etc the sofa feels just like when i got it but now i know it is not dry and going to crack worse no new cracking has showed up on the sofa couch anywhere the parts i repaired using the repair kit i bought on amazon has also held up well the areas where there were cracks are still sealed but the repair kit filler has stretched i think so it appears more visible that i patched them but not unless you really look at it however i do think that the conditioner has helped to stop any new cracks from developing all in all i wish i had put this on my sofa couch before it started to crack i do think this would have prevented any cracks from forming i may have put too much on when i put it on but after running the fans on it and wiping it down many times and now a few weeks later the couch looks great and has no sticky feeling to it at all anymore i know this may not be ideal to have a couch such you can not sit on it for a while but what i did was put a huge blanket over it until it was fully dried that allowed us to use it without any problems and if we had not treated the sofa i am sure by now there would be many more cracks in the sofa



the first photo showing the entire sofa is from about a month ago when i bought a used faux leather sofa couch

about a month later the right side top head rest began to crack

i am guessing the couch is older than i thought and it was dry and the oils from hair against it after sitting and using the couch a few times for a few hours watching tv began to break down the sofa leather

i first used the honey cleaner on it but it did not do much i then used this honey leather conditioner but it soaked into the leather fast it was hard to spread i eventually put on disposable plastic gloves and rubbed the leather honey all over the couch surfaces that are used

i was having trouble getting it to spread so likely used more than you are supposed to but i did not want the cracking to spread and ruin the couch the couch i had before this had this kind of cracking spread all over it and i had to pay to have it taken to the trash you can see the cracks in the leather head rest of the couch in the 2nd photo

those cracks did not come out from the honey leather conditioner what i did to get the cracks fixed was use the coconix brown leather and vinyl repair kit here on amazon but after i used the honey leather conditioner on it all to restore the health of the faux leather i had to wipe down the couch a few times the first 24 hours first i used paper towels and tossed them

then a old towel and then a wet old towel and wiped more off then i ran a big fan against the couch 24/7 for about 4 days and then wiped it down again with a towel i put old knit blankets over the couch for a week or so until the honey leather had completely soaked in even still if i rub my fingers on the couch they will pick up some of the substance as my fingers i have not rubbed against it will be smooth and the ones i do rub against it are a little sticky

the stickiness is getting less and less and i am sure in a few weeks it will be back to how it was it is not a very noticeable stickiness now after this i think i may just wiped it down with the honey leather cleaner every few months

i do think i needed to use this honey leather conditioner though to save the leather as it was cracking pretty bad in just a month of having it after i bought it used and it had no cracks when i bought it used all in all i am happy with this i likely used way more than is recommended

if you are wondering how this works on fake leather couches it does seem to work but does not absorb i think as fast as it does in real leather it may be that my fake leather couch has been treated as well which is why it did not soak in as fast",-,very good,very good,-,very good

"when trying out any new product line from amz there is certain criteria for form and function and for this bug zapper i choose my downstairs home office which also has a french doorway that opens to the back yard which is a tropical jungle environment things to consider 

1 packaging was well done and protective
2 instructions were clear as to uses and care instructions
3 simple to operate just pick a optimal location
4 very lightweight ez to move around
5 cleaning  is simple
6 function  at first setup i thought i got a dude as it sat there but not in an ideal location and as soon as i moved to a new location zap zap zap  now were cooking
about the short cord which is wellmade btw not flimsy like other products to me the short cord gives it more mobility as we have many many many outlets both indoors and outdoors and a ton of extension cords of various copper gauges
7 performance usage  gps location  performance is is going to be affected by the type of indoor  outdoor bug population environment light medium heavy extreme swarm  location indoor or outdoor property foot square or acre size and the total number of devices deployed  device cleaning frequency
imo multiple bug zappers work best in a lighttoalmost heavy indoor  outdoor bug population environment when you also have an active pest control company monthly services
obviously if you live next door to a steaming tropical jungle or swamp land deploying 1 or 2 devices is not going to mitigate any environment with millions of bugs you would need commercial rated zappers and other solutions ymmv

absolutely would/will buy again and is a great deal right now at 24 bucks buy two check mark︎

btw just got a notification that the warranty has just been extended for 1 additional year check mark︎check mark︎

have had it since last year of july of 2022 and loved it however today when i was walking around the house i heard an extremely loud buzzing and cackling sound and smelled smoke i ran to the kitchen where it was coming from and saw smoke and a red small flame inside it was burning a bug that had flew in it however the bug was literally on fire and getting roasted and it had been doing this for at least 34 minutes fire alarm didnt go off yet and i didnt know if i should let it keep going to see if the whole thing would catch fire or settle down but i unplugged it for safety as i was afraid it might burst or the whole thing might catch on fire and burn my house down not sure if this is normal for it to burn this much or be this loud smoky and smelly as it has never burned this bad before,-,bad,-,-,bad
ok so i have read some reviews about how this stopped working after a couple of months but let me say this is the very best use of my money that i have spent you have to understand how much this thing takes care of bugs you have to empty the bottom because it collects an area that needs dumped i would recommend ordering some replacement light bulbs because this thing works so well 24/7 you wont regret buying this item if this stops working the light bulb might just need to be replaced dont be like me and realize a little too late that you have to take down from time to time and empty the dead bug dust,good,good,good,-,good
easy to plug in and starts working  i do wish the cord would have been longer,-,very good,-,-,very good

for some reason this year we have been inundated with house flies could be new horses moved in behind us but not sure open door and they race inside we put one of these in laundry room because its back door where dog goes in and out and so is opened the most it zaps most of them the light doesnt last as long as i expected so buy extra light it is safe for pets to get near because you know curious cats must check out new things it does flood whole housevwith blue light at night but it means no turning on other lights to get around house we tried a different one but it didnt attract as many flies this one is much better,-,good,-,-,good

as soon as i received my orders i opened a packet and poured part into each drain my reason?  my cats have taken it upon themselves to use my bathrooms sinks as a pee stop and it gets trapped in my trap  this septic tank treatment worked fast and the smell was gone  now i am hoping the cats will use the litter box and not the sink drain  not sure why they ever started the toilet would be a lot better choice  i am sold on it  what it will do to the septic tank certainly cant be a bad thing,-,good,-,good,good

i was using a different brand and came across this with good reviews so thought id give it a try it costs more up front but is more economical because its enough for the whole year the other stuff ends up costing more also this is easier to use no way to spill it and there is no dust very convenient works better at keeping my septic system in good working order  ive been using it for 2 years and highly recommend it,very good,very good,very good,-,very good

silly to write a sponge review but i am only because they are neutral earth toned sponges and match my kitchen perfectly i was looking for something neutral and not a loud bright color to go in my sponge holder on my countertop soap dispenser i bought a pack of 6 they should last awhile i have not used them yet but i am happy with the look and they are ecofriendly to boot im sure they will be on my shopping list moving forward,-,very good,-,-,very good

"you know when youre shopping for something and all the highest rated best seller stuff is garbage? yeah thats how it is shopping for a broom on amazon i ended up returning 2 brooms before i tried this one because

1 the head of popular brooms are tiny now like honestly who wants a broom with an 8 inch head? what size of room are you sweeping that you want to have to make more passes to get the room clean?
2 the dustpans always fail to do their only job

but then i tried the ocedar pet pro broom  stepon dustpan powercorner and i was honestly amazed

1 the bristle tension on this thing is something else it kinda gives me asmr when im using it i cant really describe it any better than that its just like magical feeling the way they bend just perfectly

2 the head is wide good god what an important feature i literally sweep my rooms in 1/2 the time that it used to take me

3 the dustpan actually works i cannot believe for the first time in my life i have a broom/dustpan combo that i dont have to fight its unbelievable it took 33 years for this to happen but wow its a game changer when it really works

i am so obsessed with this broom that i bought a spare to put in my attic for the next 10 years so that when its finally done for i can break open a fresh one when they inevitably stop making it so good down the road

hard to believe i wrote a review for a broom but here i am lol no regrets",-,very good,very good,-,very good
"to be specific my review is for the o cedar powercorner pet pro broom  dust pan because they make many different models this is the broom for hardwood or bamboo or their engineered cousins the tips of the bristles are spliced fluffy and the bristles themselves are soft enough to bend so that you can sweep without flicking dirt and dust everywhere it effectively gathers very fine siltlike dust as well as pet hair

this isnt an allpurpose item its totally worth the money for getting extremely tiny nearly invisible dust and ittybitty floaty pet hair collected in the pan its always way more than i thought was on the floor

my only complaint is that the dustpan doesnt snap securely to the handle

we have an extremely stiff brush/broom that is for concrete such as sidewalks or a patio and a medium stiff broom for a painted basement floor dedicated tools are great because my house broom stays cleaner no motor oil  no mud",very good,very good,-,very good,very good
"due to i cedars microfiber mop being super light weight and bad compared to the ones that came before it i was so hesitant to get this mop but i think they learned from customer feedback because this broom is so heavy duty and flooded across the floor like butter i am so happy i bought it the price is way low compared to the quality of this set

oh and my toddler is out of a job now she didnt get to hold the dust pan for me because the foot thing is so awesome

she did however get to sweep her room because the broom can be made shorter by just taking out the middle rod

great for really short people and kids

if you cant tell im in love smiling face with hearts",very good,very good,-,-,very good
this is my new inside broom for the kitchen  it works super well to get all the pet hair dry catdog food and crumbs  tracked in grassdirt from the yard the angled bristles get under the cabinets  into the corners  it gets all the small particles as well  has a nice wide sweep to pick up a lot at once i really like the step on dustpan design it has a handle that you step on to keep it right where u want it while sweeping also stores on the broom handle this is a very nice broom  im really happy with it its high quality  works excellently getting things cleaned up,-,very good,-,very good,very good
the broom is effective as are all other ocedar brooms ive owned i love that i can loosen hair in the dustpan claws  also position  hold the dustpan while manipulating the broom effectively from a standing position i dont mind bending over but you lose power with the broomstick when coming at it from below the problem? the handy channel for attaching the dustpan to broomhandle for storing is great for thatbut when i sweep the dirt into the dustpan some goes through that very channel  spills out the other side ive tried being as careful as i can but i cant seem to avoid this happening every time would love for someone to tell me gently what im doing wrong i usually vacuum after sweeping anyway so its not a complete disaster but would be nicer if what i swept could just be tossed more directly into the trash from the dustbin,-,very good,very good,-,very good
i wanted a really good broom and dustpan where when you went to sweep into the dustpan it actually went into the dustpan instead of the gap between the dustpan and the floor this set is the best i never have to adjust the dustpan to get the rest of the dustit all goes in the dustpan in the first swipe and its so nice to be able to step on the dustpan instead of bending over and holding it while trying to sweep up your pile i totally recommend this broom set,-,very good,-,-,very good
i replaced a broom that i didnt realized had “aged” so poorly until i got this  it cleans my floor in one swipe no muss no fuss and as a mom of little ones it gives me a thrill,-,poor,-,-,poor
ive always liked ocedar products this broom lives up to its name it has a nice wide sweeping head it cleans the floor in one pass the dustpan stays flat on the floor and collects everything smoothly without multiple swipes  it was easy to assemble  the broom can be easily and conveniently stored with the dustpan on the broom handle and using the eyehole in the handle to hang it up,-,-,-,-,-
"review of oxo good grips soap dispensing dish brush 15x10x5cm

i bought one first to make sure it worked for my purpose then i bought the second one a couple of weeks later i saw a tip online from a pro house cleaner which is to fill this with regular dawn dish soap and white vinegar about 3/4 to 1/4 ratio and keep it in your shower each day while you are showering just pick a place to scrub in your shower and rinse off youll have a sparkly shower with very little effort and wow does it work best cleaning hack ive ever picked up from online lol this brush is easy to fill i mix my mixture in a measuring cup first then pour into the brush with ease easy to hold the brush head is nice a stiff for scrubbing i like that the brush head is replaceable when that is needed i have one in each shower and even the kids can keep their own shower clean i cant speak for longevity its only been a few weeks",-,very good,-,-,very good
"i bought this item for the first time at bed bath  beyond i was looking for just a standard scrub brush and was actually disappointed that all they had was this gimmicky scrub brush with an embedded soap dispenser but this thing immediately turned out to be my main clean up tool in the kitchen great on pots and pans great on surfaces even useful for cleaning up shoes or anything else

the soap reservoir lasts a good long time the brush is comfortable in your hand ergonomically designed

the only flaw is that the rubber soap dispenser button does wear out over time causing a fatal leak in the soap reservoir but its such a handy tool i didnt at all mind buying a replacement a year or two later

this is a great gift for friends or family members everyone i know who has tried it has become a big fan",-,very good,very good,very good,very good
this is the only brush that can get my husband to help with dishes we love it because its easy to use doesnt get your hands dirty holds the soap but also has a button that lets you dispense as much or as little soap as you need it scrubs really well and has that extra plastic scrubber on the top for caked on foods it rinses so much easier than other brushes and dries between uses so its way more sanitary than sponge brushes love this brush,-,very good,-,-,very good

when i first got these it was because of them being forceflex  i always try to get scented bags i thought theyd be like the other scented bags  you can smell them barely until into the can then no more smell but these have an excellent scent that stays with the bags for a while i didnt realize my husband had a few near me getting ready to take them outside  i kept smelling a really clean scent  was trying to track it down never thinking of the trash bags they retain the smell long after exposed to the air everyone has different perceptions of smells i happen to like this one a lot but if the others have as strong and smell their a bit more predictable in what they smell like as far as strength,-,very good,-,-,very good
easy sweeping that picks up everything they may seem pricey but even after it looks like the swiffer pet duster cloth is full it keeps grabbing stuff so one cloth does one floor completely no noisy vacuum no dust flying from under a broom no pressure required and it slides under furniture easily if necessary top it off with a swiffer wet cloth on the same mop handle and wipe wherever needed  i have six dogs and 3 cats inside which means i sweep every day sometimes twice a day it makes it so much easier to clean up after them no mixing water in a bucket and wringing out a mop,neutral,-,neutral,-,neutral

a family member rescued a friendly large male tabby cat he promptly began marking his new home primarily rugs in two bathrooms and my office we scrubbed carpets diligently and repeatedly to no avail we replaced one carpet with laminated wood flooring— a costly remedy my son read about the charcoal bags solution we were skeptical at firstbut the cost for the first set was less then 30 and worth a try the bags come with hooks and we hung them close to the carpet in my office we noticed an immediate decline in the offensive order after two days in a week it was gone we will soon recharge the bags by placing them outside in the sun and rehang them in the other bathroom i highly recommend this product for reducing odors in a natural manner and saving money in the process,very good,-,very good,-,very good
"purchased these to use in our closets and laundry space at home ive definitely noticed a difference in reducing musty and stale odors from the house this wasnt any sort of big issue with my home but i felt it wouldnt hurt to have something to make the house smell a bit cleaner this seems to do the trick i should also add that ive hung up nine of these which i believe is part of the secret to having them work effectively

they are fairly small packets that are mounted in a neutral fabric covering making them hardly noticeable  they do lose their ability to capture odors over time so you have to take them to an outdoor location and let them sit in the sun for several hours to refresh themselves",-,very good,very good,very good,very good
i have ordered thousands of items from amazon and have never written a reviewtill now  we recently had inlaws stay with us for 5 months in a small studio basically a glorified bedroom with its own entrance and ensuite but attached to our house  bacon sausage or other greasy fatty meat was cooked on a hot plate multiple times per week our mistake for providing it in the first place they left a couple weeks ago and ive been besides myself trying to get the stale grease smell out everything washable has been laundered multiple times walls floors furniture and ceilings have been scrubbed with vinegar then bleach then sprayed with air freshener and then all over again baking soda has been placed strategically it was about 50 better but was still stinking up the rest of the house i was ready to torch the place and bought these charcoal packs out of desperation put them out in the afternoon sun yesterday afternoon and then hung them strategically around the room and closed it up for the night this morning i went in to open everything up for the daily airing out routine and the smell was gone  i couldnt believe it not sure if its possible but its like the smell was sucked out of the walls  these little miracle packets will always be in stock in my house from now on,-,neutral,neutral,-,neutral

arrived as described nicely packaged with hooks to hang in the closets also works well on a shelf or tucked away out of sight pulling out odors the refresher of the packets simply by setting in the sun is a great help low maintenance and reduces repurchasing great product,-,very good,-,very good,very good
cat went in my sons closet and it was nasty after cleaning it very well the smell was lingering so i ordered these i put three in his closet and three in his room it workedish after 3 days i would say its for very small spaces not an instant fix but it might be working hard to tell after days,-,poor,-,-,poor

ive used versions of these pads for many years and have always liked them they do a great job of cleaning toilets including under the rim they can be hard to find in brickandmortar stores and ive never seen packages with this number of refills so i was glad to come upon these after cleaning i leave the pads in the toilet for a couple of hours both to give the chemicals more time to be in contact with the toilet surface and to let them break down some before i flush them,-,very good,very good,very good,very good
i thought this to be an interest concept when it first came out then out comes a different variation on a theme with a different style wand i like this version that i have been using for several years but these pads are getting harder to find locally in the stores next time i order i may order two boxes i get the feeling obsolescence is creeping up on this product,-,-,good,good,good

"i thought the price was a bargin for a name brand product now i know why it was priced so low

 first it was shipped to me with the tops unsecured so they all arrived opened thankfully only one leaked

this product started out okay then fizzed out after the first 3 uses it doesnt get my dishes clean made a black ring around my sink drain leaves white sheets and flakes of residue on dishes in the dishwasher and inside the inner workings of the machine the fact that these sheets are solid and hard cant be good for the mechanics of your machine and im sure it takes away from its life span theres also the fact that im having to waste water and throw away money rewashing the dishes with another name brand that actually gets the job done ive actually used store brands that worked far better than this

i admit i saw the negative reviews and i thought those folks must have hard water or something i dont so i went ahead and bought it dont waste your money folks

i said i would stop writing detailed reviews on amazon because it seems that if you submit anything written in a detailed fashion in a way that suggests you have anything above average education or vocabulary it gets scrutinize to death by amazon  so let them do with this as they well however i felt this had to be shared as today there are far too many companies selling low quality products and getting away with it i for one am frankly fed up with it i work too hard to throw away my money
update 2/6/23
i switched back to my regular dishwasher detergents and after doing an empty cycle with pure vinegar to see if it would help ive noticed that my machine no longer gets my dishes clean as before ive done several cycles wasted goodness know how much water detergent and moneyto no avail
fed up and hopping mad i called the company that makes this awful product to calmly explain to them i got every excuse under the sun the problem is the practically new machine the water isnt getting hot enough to melt the detergent she asked me what setting im using well being that there is nothing that says the machine has to be on a certain setting i dont see how that matters next your wash cycle isnt long enough doesnt say on the bottle that a machine needs to be set on a cycle that runs a certain amount of time then it was the water temp isnt getting hot enough what does it need to be set to purgatory? probably so to melt this stuff she said to run the hot water a bit before doing dishes upon thinking this made no sense because the machine heats the water as well the dishes come out piping hot so hot that if you touch on it will burn you so i asked her are you telling me that throughout the whole course of the washing process the water isnt getting hot enough to melt this stuff lastly its buildup because i only use vinegar to clean my machine now pure vinegar is quite acidic i use it to clean my stove and it melts away grease with no problem yeah its built up alright a build up of finish that has clogged up my machine

 ive never had a problem with my machine until i used finish and vinegar is all i ever used i know people that have only used vinegar for years and theyve had no problems at all but then they havent used finish in their machines and yes i called around to friends and family to check being that im desperate to not have to wash dishes by hand because of a medical condition i also certainly dont want to have to spend money to replace an almost new machine

they dont want to take responsibility i find it strange that i have been using store brand mostly with not a single problem everything melts without me having to worry about there not being a purgatory settingon my machine dishes have always come out sparkling clean with no spots i dont put greasy dishes or pots in my machine either the dishes are practically clean when i put them in they are put in a sink of dish liquid until i am ready to rise and load them in the machine i never even have use a rinse agent the cycle is long enough to work with every other product

she would not address why every other product ive used worked great and my machine worked wonderful until i used finish hmm i wonder why?

 dont buy this stuff folks i wouldnt suggest trying it if they were giving it away free and paying you to use it

update 3/27/23  so i received  a call from on 2/ 7 that made me mad enough to contemplate calling my lawyer the little psychopath that works there there called me and told me that i was not supposed to be using liquid detergent in my type dishwasher i informed her that liquid detergents are all ive ever used in it since ive had it i told her that ive never had any problems with any of the other liquid detergents
that was the best excuse they could come up with you better believe they were looking for any way not to take responsibility had it not been that it would been you shouldnt have been washing dishes in the machine you should take em down by the river with a scrub board and a cake of lye soap because you put dishes in the machine it caused our product to mess up your machine

seeing that i was hopping mad and ready for a fight  i rarely get this mad but im tired of getting the shaft and the kiss off my mom said what about that home appliance insurance you pay for

now get this folks in the middle of telling the guy about my machine he pipes in and asks me did you use finish? he asked me this before i could completely describe the problem and before i could even tell him id used finish in my machine he then proceeded to tell me i wasnt the only one he said the running joke around there is they  named the product right because it will surely finish you dishwasher  i told him truer words have never been spoken if you asked me the named should be changed from reckitt to racket because they really do have a good racket going making money off a product thats no good but detrimental to your machine

my new replacement machine arrived over the past weekend and all is right in my world

 but you can bet i will never use another product made by this company airwick clearasil durex enfamil ky mucinex ridx woolite resolve neuiva megared biofreeze cepacol delsym easy off lysol nutramigen veet digestive advantage finish airborne move free botanical origin  queen vand anything else i find is made be reckitt or subsidiaries

i went through my cabinets pantry and storage closet making sure to discard any products made by them did the fridge and medicine cabinets too just in case i sure wouldnt be fool hearted enough to use any of their ingestible products not even a rub efficient because whatever you rub on your body gets into your bloodstream

btw if youve been after the hubby to buy you a new dishwasher get ya some finish once it assassinates your dishwasher hell have no choice but to buy you a new one",very good,very good,very good,very good,very good
i recently had to repair my dishwasher and noticed a bit of chunks from those washing tablets that never fully dissolved as such i opted to go back to the old liquid dishwasher detergent now this stuff was pretty inexpensive which is why i got it normally i hand wash dishes and only use the dishwasher if theres a huge pile of dishes or something there is a weird very chemical smell to this which was a little off putting i was hoping that smell wouldnt make its way into my dishes so i gave it run after the cycle completed though that smell was gone dishes were ok in terms of cleanliness but no smell to them i guess this stuff is ok for intermittent use,very good,very good,-,-,very good

theyre much more moist than im used to for the price of flushable wipes im willing to pay i usually end up with something i can tell isnt dry but i wouldnt call it moist

they also have a textured and smooth side but both are super soft they textured side just cleans a bit better when it looks like everything has mostly been cleaned off you can use the textured side to be sure and usually find a bit more that was left to clean

theyre great for a quick face cleaning as well as general body use for any dirt pollen sweat etc you might have picked up to feel quickly refreshed
or for those of us who are disabled and have difficulty showering as often as wed like theyre sturdy enough not to tear while scrubbing but definitely not rough enough to exfoliate anything and of course theyre “no rinse” washing so while they help quite a bit still not as much as the more expensive kind w/soap made for washing yourself
they also flush without any difficulty or clogging several months and 2 packs but not a single plumbing problem or having to flush twice",very good,very good,-,-,very good
they are cheap and they work only issue is that they are thin enough to get some poo on your hand if you dont double it over also they will rip if you try to really clean the area in my opinion its better to spend the extra penny per wipe to get something that works a little better,very good,very good,-,-,very good

"when i opened the package i thought i was going to be sending these right back  they were so thin they felt like tissue paper  then i thought might as well give them a try  to my surprise the bags worked just fine in our 13 gallon kitchen trash can  we havent had any problems with tearing nothing worse than we were getting with the cheap white glad bags from publix  im happy to be sending less plastic to the landfill as long as the product functions so im a satisfied customer  i like how the gathered bottom helps them fit in the can  i was unsure about the lack of flaps or drawstring but ive been able to gather and tie them without any drama  overall a super inexpensive product that helps our kitchen trash stay sleek and unobtrusive  this order will last us for the next five years or so but when we run out ill buy these again

these are not contractor bags nor do they claim to be they are thin but far stronger than regular trash bags so 5 stars from me currently i am using these in my kitchen trash can while also throwing in some light construction materials for anything with nails or concrete ill use the thicker bags but for everything else these work great,-,very good,-,-,very good
i saw my contractor using these lightweight bags at my home i asked him about them and he gave me the info they ar lightweight and will tear easily but the hold a bunch as long as you do not rip or puncture them and they are cheap perfect for collecting a garbage full of junk and dumping down the trash chute in my condo i was tired of paying contractor bag price for a thick bag that was over kill fr the task out had and the quantity of bags you get for 50 odd dollars makes them a steal,bad,bad,-,-,bad

"the basic swiffer wet pads are great but i like these for also adding a freshly cleaned smell to the room after i run them through my cleaning of the house tends to be semifrequent swiffering with my steam mop to get up the really bad spots where stuff has fallen to the floor and this keeps the floors reasonably clean with very little effort

i find the lavender pads to be a nice upgrade overall but would caution users that these really dont work well to get dried on messes off the floor without a good bit of work these clear just the surface dust and particulate on the ground if you want to clean a spill you will either be scrubbing overly much with a flimsy handle or will need to resort to other cleaning options my suggestion for the harder to clean spots is a good steam mop which you can just hover over a problem and effortlessly pick them up

one other point of feedback which is either for the pads or the mop itself is that vigorous use tends to detach them from the mop element im not sure if im putting them on wrong or if this is actually a problem in either the pads or the mop itself but its annoying",-,bad,-,-,bad
"still the best mopping pad out there i have tried all the brands on the market and keep coming back to this as nothing else cleans better for my high traffic vinyl floor in the hall way i know how much dirt this can pick up i end up having to use 3 wet pads over the same area to get it clean the dirt does not show but once i mop with these wet pads they turn black so thats my guage with other wet pads nothing comes off and i know they is lying to me

this fabric shaver was exactly what i needed to give new life to my couch it also comes precharged so you can use it directly out of the box it makes a pleasant buzzing noise when turned on and ive found that it works best when you go in circular motions around the areas that need to be shaved while i love that it is rechargeable unlike many battery operated fabric shavers the only downside to this is that if you are using it over a large item like a couch it may take a couple recharges to finish the whole thing i had to recharge it 3 times to fully do a 96in couch plus all the cushions but my couch was also covered in pilling so i went over every inch of it this shouldnt be a problem if youre only using it for clothing it is easy to open and clean out the fuzz it collects and its usually full around the same time that the power dies all in all it was easy to use doesnt damage the fabric and leaves things looking brand new again highly recommend,-,very good,very good,very good,very good
just received today and ill say im impressed especially considering the price my clothes felt brand new and rejuvenated the fabric making  it soft again its gentle and safe to use on delicate fabric the bottom of my ugg comforter had lent and i was able to apply decent amount of pressure and there was no ripping or tearing of the fabric  i had to go over the fabric a couple of times to get it completely off but it still was very easy to use and effective my product came fully charged and i used it for over an hour and theres still battery left im interested to see how it last over time the design is nice and simple i cant speak about its durability but purely based off performance its amazing,very good,very good,very good,very good,very good
this works really well on piling and even on “burned” clothes ive had to use the laundromat for my laundry recently and a lot of times the dryers are so hot that they make clothes feels crispy within minutes even if theyre still wet mainly things like my fluffy blankets i cant afford new blankets and other clothing items of mine the dryers have affected but a few passes over the crispy spots and this makes it almost as good as new i used it for over an hour the other day just trying to make my clothes feel better and it didnt die on me easily rechargeable and easy to clean just be sure if you take out lint behind the silver part youre delicate with the part with the metal pieces behind it,-,very good,very good,-,very good
i love this thing it has revitalized so much of my wardrobe that i was thinking of getting rid of because off the pilling from sweaters to winter socks this shaver is great to remove piling i have had it nick a few items because i was getting sloppy with it just be careful around seams etc and you shouldnt have any trouble ive had this and used it regularly for several months and its still going strong definitely worth the purchase,-,very good,-,-,very good
let me start by saying i never write reviews but this thing has changed my life ive had issues with pilling specifically on my jersey fitted sheet for a long time i kept buying new ones washing them differently and lint rolling but nothing worked this thing is amazing it completely removed all of the pilling from our sheets and they felt soft and brand new again ive spent hundreds on leggings from highend brands only to end up with a ton of pilling on the inner thighs this removes that too buy this it is literally amazing,-,very good,very good,-,very good
this thing works so great i never leave reviews but this product is just too good i bought it for my sheets and shirts and it works amazing its great that its wireless so you can use it on anything it also collects all of the pilling lint so theres no mess it didnt leave any holes or anything and the product is so cheap it took 5 minutes to completely transform my sheets to back to new buy this,very good,very good,-,-,very good
charged this guy for a couple hours  spent maybe 20 minutes using it on my couch i wish id taken before  after photos because im so impressed with how my couch looks now it looks much less worn/old thanks to this thing i havent tried it on clothes yet but im stoked with how easy it was to use  with the results,-,very good,-,-,very good
came fully charged which was a bonus so i could start using it right out of the box at first i was super frustrated and grumbling about fake reviews because it did absolutely nothing then i realized i had not removed the clear cap amazing what a difference that made lol once i removed the cap the little shaver worked like a charm and has saved me a lot of money as i was able to fix several sweatshirts that i no longer wore due to obvious pillage around “the ladies” and where my arms rub on the sides grinning squinting face,very good,very good,-,very good,very good
i personally use these to clean up my cats litter box theyre a really good size the whole litter scoop fits perfectly and the bags have a very subtle scent that helps mask the smell of the waste my only complain was that the plastic bag it came in was ripped but not a big deal since nothing was missing i think its worth the money would def buy again,very good,very good,-,very good,very good
these bags are great sturdy but they stink like old lady perfume the scent is god awful unfortunately i wont buy them again because of that,-,-,-,-,-

i mean weve all been using these for years theyve been around forever because theyre as great as they are i get them through the subscribe and save theyre universal to put anything in them and keep it together i love them i try to not use generic just because they dont hold up the same as a ziplock bag ill pay the extra for a name i know i can trust because its a better quality the seals on the side are better the locking system is better i like the slide lock it has a flat bottom to hold so you can pour things into it easier its a smart brand you cant get that with generic brands its just worth the money and it lasts longer wash them out and keep using them,very good,very good,-,-,very good
great and use all the time,-,very good,very good,-,very good

"these are the only bags i use it took some trial and error before i figured out how they name their closures but now that i have ive stocked up on these and dont think ill ever run out

let me put it this way when a baggie starts affecting your self esteem its time to kick it to the curb right?

well thats what the kind that are supposed to seal together easily when you simply press the two sides together did to me they made me feel like an incompetent boob

i have a disability which limits my ability to grip or to hold on to things and me and those baggies would fight every time i used them they seemed to be unzipped in parts and it drove me crazy and made me feel terrible id scream at it cry and yell youre supposed to be easy it looks easy on tv is it you or me? please tell me help me understand where this relationship is going

then a friend told me it sounded like i was being gaslighted aha i looked it up and the symptoms were all there so i dumped the old baggie and moved on when a baggie starts to hurt your self esteem makes you feel bad about yourself dont stay in that relationship a moment longer pick these up and dont doubt your decision not for a second

these are fabulous they zip right up and you know theyre zipped no half asked stuff like old mr baggie before him lets regret to him as the other guy from now on eh? nope theres a new baggie in town and he even stands up tall and proud

ive had problems with field mice forever because i live on the side of a mountain weve set traps and i grimaced every time i found one in the trap with their cute little faces but hey one of us has to go and it aint gonna be me recently the thing i dreaded the most happened a rat i panicked i could not understand how something that big could get in i have 2 cats and theyre worthless lol i set one of those giant traps and i got it i also plugged up the big hole hiding under my porch where it apparently dug its way in so i had heard of the electronic pest control and i thought they were a gimmick until i started to read the reviews i decided to try them it was a small amount to pay compared to an exterminator and id rather stop them before they try to get in in the first place well here i am a few months later and no rodents i even had giant spyder crickets coming up from our cellar and theyre gone too wonderful product thank you,-,-,bad,-,bad
so far i am very pleased with the results  living in louisiana we have lots of lil bugs that love to sneak inside and of course lets not forget the mosquitoes i installed the zero pest repellers yesterday and have already notice a difference the zero pest repeller is a white lightweight plastic rectangular product that plugs into a standard outlet the repeller has a power button when pushed once turns the repeller on and an ambient blue light emits from it your unit is on and working and you get a soft light night light as a bonus if you push the power button a second time it will emit a high frequency sound and a third touch of the power button turns the unit off  i have a repeller placed in each room in my home and will be purchasing more for our 2 camps,-,very good,very good,-,very good
was not sure if it would work but it really has did not drive them out of the house but based on the placement it drove the rodent toward the traps to be caught 6 set up works well we would turn on the audio intermittently so they did not get use to it sound annoying to humans but my k9 not affected in 2 days made a big difference will continue to use periodically to ensure they get the message that the hotel is closed and are not welcome,-,neutral,-,-,neutral
i decided to give this try in my new apartment cause i noticed some bugs here and there so after reading some reviews and doing research i went ahead and grabbed the pack since it has 6 in each pack currently i live in a 1 bedroom apartment about 700 square feet i put one in the kitchen one near the front door one in the bathroom and one out on the patio the reason i put one in the kitchen and bathroom is because that is were i saw some bugs running around mind you i didnt have a huge infestation it was just every now and then i saw some bugs and after using these for over a month now and i did see some bugs here and there even with these  things plugged in so i still got pest control involved but with both these plugged in and after the pest control came and sprayed my apartment thankfully i havent seen any bugs at all i leave them plugged in just in case and they are working well they do the job just make sure you check to see what the reviews say if you have a huge infestation then i would recommend getting pest control involved first than grab these just to help keep bugs away i definitely recommend this product,-,very good,-,-,very good
i bought a pack of 6 about 3 months ago first they arrived fast as simple as possible to install the issue we have been having is my girlfriend and i live in an apartment in sc when we moved in there was so much wrong with the place the one thing that was terrible was we were getting cockroaches non stop this is an issue throughout the entire complex i am a bit of a clean freak so my place is always as clean as can be the cockroach issue was addressed from many tenants the office sent out an exterminator when i tell you that every single hallway in this complex was filled with hundreds of dead cockroaches its no lie absolutely gross thing is a few weeks later they are back in the apartments even until this day 2 years later so i had enough of stomping on these damn things i put coffee beans near the front door and the storage closet that worked really good because the whole time the beans were down no cockroaches but again im a clean freak and coffee beans all over the floor became annoying so that is when i purchased this item since plugging all 6 in outlets i can say that it does work well im pretty sure at least after taking the coffee beans away we have only seen maybe 4 cockroaches in our place in the past 3 months 3 of which where laying on the floor dead the other i chased down i have a 1 1/2 year lab who is not bothered at all with the repeller plugged in so it wont effect your animals at all im still constantly looking for cockroaches especially in the middle of the night when its completely dark luckily there has been nothing so from going 2 years with this ridiculous disgusting cockroach issue and having downstairs neighbors who have a disgusting smell come out of their place every time they open their door which i believe the cockroaches were coming from their place to now having barely any in my apartment is fantastic granted i want to say the cockroach issue is over i cant but this repeller has with out a doubt helped immensely bottom line if you are having any type of pest issues buy this it wont completely solve the issue but it definitely helps to lessen those nasty things big time,-,bad,bad,-,bad
i bought these after dealing with a significant mice infestation my neibor was a major hoarder and his family cleaned his house out and lone and behold they all came to my place i would set traps but coundnt catch them but could hear them in my walls bought these a couple weeks ago and never really thought to much more about them since i kept hearing them tonight was the purge  i could literally see them running kind of in a daze it seemed through the house all of my traps were loaded with them and have caught 15 so far we are on the 2nd week and i have definitely seen an uptick in activity like the product says you will it definitely has seemed to flush them out,-,very good,-,-,very good

"these work really well instead of taking out the trash like i asked my teenage boys will just shove the garbage down and pile all the empty energy drink cans fast food wrappers tissues better not to ask and other miscellaneous scrap from their bedrooms that they finally cleaned on top of the mostly filled kitchen garbage in what i can only assume to be a herculean task they then push or stomp everything down close the lid and disappear
i arrive later to throw away my coffee grounds only to see the overfilled bin since the boys are nowhere to be found i grab the drawstrings of the bag and pull the bag refuses to lift out so i continue to bicep curl the drawstrings and the can lifts off the ground the drawstrings stretch a bit but do not break i place the can down and then clamp it with both feet and use both hand to curl the bag it finally works free i lift it out to see all kinds of strange sharp objects testing the strength of the bag but they dont break through i then stumble down the stairs with the overpacked garbage bag and deposit it in the waste can for pick up upon return to the kitchen i promptly put a new bag in knowing full well that if i dont that my wonderful offspring will just throw whatever they have into the can and then later have no knowledge of who did it or it could have possibly happened luckily the calming scent of lavender and vanilla that wafts from the bag as i flap it about to open it and insert into the kitchen garbage can helps to quell my irritation

i like this product this removes the oil that sticks to my varnished kitchen cabinet what i did was i put small amount of murphys oil on the  microfiber cloth and scrub the cabinet as i scrub or wipe the hard sticky oil on my cabinet i started to feel that my rug started to slide easier as the oil was removed or wiped out of the surface,-,-,-,-,-
love murphys oilive been using other products on my floor and cabinets i had forgotten about this cleaner nothing compares to how murphys cleans my wood floors and cabinets  make sure you use warm water  i actually boil the water and use it with the murphys,-,very good,-,-,very good
for one i dont like the scent of citronella but fortunately the scent doesnt linger so i am going to try and find a central oil or some thing i can add to my mixture to reduce the citronella scent the other problem is i did not realize and maybe i just didnt read it in the description that it was concentrated so you have to figure out how much you need to add to a spray bottle it does work great though its the only thing that can really get my kitchen cabinets clean,-,very good,-,very good,very good
me agrado deja el piso maravilloso,-,-,-,-,-

love the results i got a great deal,-,very good,-,-,very good
overall i like it love that i can use my own cleaner and dont have to buy refill cartridges definitely a money saver the refillable bottle is kinda small and it your doing a large area it will need to be refilled could be bigger a plus and minus the spray radios is very big which is good the only issue with that is because its such a large spray radios you tend to have to go back over the section you just cleaned because of the over spray the quality of the mop its self could be better if you use a cleaner that produces foam or bubbles it will clog a little easy fix just remove the bottle and put in back on it will remove the clog and spray as it should i would say the pros definitely outweigh the cons and i think i would purchase it again,very good,very good,-,very good,very good
pros i really love the reusable washable microfiber pads theyre nice and thick and wash well i put a tablespoon of mr clean liquid concentrate in the spray bottle part and fill the rest with water it makes my vinyl wood floor smell so nice and doesnt overwet it cons i wish there were an easier way to remove the pad from the mop head—it uses a strong velcro type stick and since  the mop head is on a swivel it can be a little difficult and dirty to pull it off also the mop handle could stand to be a few inches longerim 57 and i have to lean over quite a bit using it it would save my back a little discomfort overall its really good for such a cheap price id say its definitely worth it for anyone considering buying,very good,very good,-,very good,very good
i love this mop it makes cleaning my floor so much faster and easier the head is super long and covers a big space with every pass and i love the swivel it has to help me get into tight corners we downsized to a smaller home with zero carpets and lots of furniture so i have a lot of tight spaces to deal with the swivel head is a huge plus i can manuever the mop into the sideways position and squeeze inbetween all of the tight areas we have i also love that it lays super flat i can get underneath the couches coffeetable our beds etc the two mop pads are great super high quality and durable they really grab up the grime and wash well i read tons of reviews about this product and knew that the bottle that holds the cleaning solution was a bit small and some people had trouble with it either leaking or not squirting thankfully i dont have the leaking or squirting issues and im able to mop without having to fill the bottle up a second time but i usually dont mop our 2nd or 3rd bedrooms my squirt trigger works great it evenly disperses fluid and there is no leaking either if i could change one thing it would definitely be the length if the handle was 12 inches longer it would be perfect im only 5 ft 5 in and i can feel myself sort of bending over to push it even so i love this mop it makes cleaning my floor so much easier its great to use on deep cleaning days and when i just want to give the floor a quick clean when im lazy just be aware that if youre tall you might find the length of this mop a bit of a pain to push in order to apply the right pressure,-,very good,very good,very good,very good
"i bought this with the intent to use it as a dry sweeper you know like swifter but much bigger

now to the mopping part i use a lysol  bleach fabric softener water mixture it has never leaked nor gotten clogged up it has a pretty wide spray which i love it cleans even the hard ground in spots with ease

"ive had this mop for about 6 months now  and i used to love my wet jet but this is so much better i love that i can make my own cleaning solution the mop heads are reusable do yourself a favor and buy extra so far theyve lasted this long being used weekly sometimes daily with dogs the spray is a really nice wide spray i would say the only possible downside is that the spray does tend to get on my cabinets just because the spray is super wide so i have to make sure its angled down a bit i love that it doesnt take batteries
and then wash and hang dry the pads otherwise they can shrink ive also tied a microfiber cloth to the mop head in a pinch and it worked grinning squinting face",-,very good,very good,-,very good
i love how convenient it is i just wish the sprayer worked better the solution containers plastic is that of like a plastic water bottle im not sure how long thatll last the spray is pretty weak i find myself trying to position the mop angle exactly and spraying multiple times so that  enough solution comes out other than that very handy just mop and go,-,very good,very good,very good,very good
obviously i needed a mop that was reliable and easy to use and this mop is it it doesnt stop in its tracks while mopping and doesnt flip its super easy to put together and clean i just empty the spray bottle completely until theres no suds left and i let it air dry its recommended to wash the pads after every use to avoid mildew and bacteria wash it with warm water and a little detergent since its microfiber then i put it in the dryer on the lowest setting which for me is the delicate dry setting it leaks a tiny bit but to me its not a big deal and its better than the o cedar spin mop which is what i tried before  this,-,very good,-,very good,very good
i got the blue one and its super easy to use and gets into small spaces well the handle is weak so its not the best at scrubbing stuck on stains and dirt but it gets the job done the solution holder is a lot smaller than i expected but im ok with refilling it it didnt leak and has a decent spray i love that i can use my normal floor cleaner and it doesnt need expensive refills it got my gross floors clean in no time so over all its a decent product,very good,very good,very good,-,very good

i handwash and reuse them including the lids  the lids snap on tightly and so far no leaks  i do have to be careful snapping the lid on  running my fingers around the lid rather than just pushing down on it  if too much pressure is applied the wall of the container will bend but slow and careful works every time  there is an audible click when the seal is made

this is a decent product  i thought the silicone blade might work better than the previous rubber squeegee we had but they are actually very comparable  the only recommendation i would have is to have the handle angled more upright  the handle is tilted downward which makes it a little difficult to clean all the way to the bottom of the shower glass because the handle hits the bottom before the blade does,-,good,-,-,good
so light and easy to use  hangs in the suction device on the wall  small perfect for clearing water off the shower wall bought for my mother while visiting her and going to get one of my own when i return home,-,very good,-,-,very good
squeegee works good the blade is not as thin and flexible as i would like but good for the price the suction cup holder doesnt stick to my shower tile wall or even my bathroom mirror so i have a string looped through the hole in the handle and it hangs on a hook on the shower caddy,very good,very good,-,-,very good
this is comfortable to hold and has a nice feel on the grip  it is easy to swing and could be used as a zombie killer in a pinch  the blade is so sharp that i can slice the shower stream in half in a single blow i often find myself hacking apart the stream of water imagining the resulting splash as zombie icor  the zombies have no chance against me during shower time  after a long hot shower of decimating the horde i can also use this little gem to squeegee off the glass walls of my shower  works great,-,very good,very good,-,very good
we use a squeegee to wipe down the shower so this tool gets regular use it gets into the base of the walls very nicely and it wipes very thoroughly with very little force the handle is large enough and has texture to make it easy to hold so that you dont have to squeeze it very hard  i have owned a lot of squeegees for showers window cleaning and other uses this is the best one i have ever had for showers  though it is a bit small for windows im sure it would provide a very clean swipe on them too  i always enjoy giving a good review to great products like this oh i bought another as a backup,-,very good,-,-,very good

"i recently purchased the broom and dustpan combo and while it was a decent product overall i had one major issue with it the broom was not wide enough to effectively sweep large areas

on the positive side the broom and dustpan combo was easy to use and assemble the broom had sturdy bristles that effectively swept up dirt and debris and the dustpan had a rubber lip that prevented dust and dirt from escaping additionally the set was compact and easy to store making it a great option for small spaces

however i found the narrow width of the broom to be a significant drawback when sweeping large areas i had to make several passes to cover the same ground which was timeconsuming and inefficient additionally the broom handle was a bit shorter than i would have preferred which made it somewhat uncomfortable to use for extended periods

overall while i found the broom and dustpan combo to be a decent product the narrow width of the broom was a significant drawback if you have a small space and only need to sweep up small areas this product may work well for you however if you have a larger space to clean you may want to consider a wider broom or a different product altogether",-,very good,very good,very good,very good

another thing i really like about the broom is its bristles theyre soft enough to not scratch my floors but theyre also tough enough to pick up dirt and debris

overall im very happy with this broom and dustpan its the perfect tool for sweeping up dust and debris and its made a huge difference in my cleaning routine

here are some of the things i like about the broom and dustpan

"the scrubbing bubble home invasion of 2023

this took place last monday which im certain you remember because any reader in the continental united states could smell my bathroom from your own home

i was excited to try out a product that cuts down on cleaning time and didnt take time to learn how to dispense a single stamp i ended up with 6 gels inside the hall toilet then a single gel in the master suite

the battle lines were drawn

this is not an air freshener this is not an odor remover this is a tsunami of manufactured citrus scent that will infuse every molecule of every square inch you own it is a scent so solid you can see it if you squint a little

once the battle started it was a fight to the death forcibly removing the gels and flushing them didnt solve the problem the leftover air from the hall and master bath formed a pincer movement and expertly invaded the attic lighting a match and using the fan only increased its confidence my husband could smell the citrus from the pipes to his basement toilet there is no escape and no turning back i will be smelling citrus gel stamps three days after im dead

dont make my mistake read the directions and practice your stamping technique the air supply you save might be your own",-,neutral,neutral,-,neutral
"does not last even close to up to 12 days per stamp/glob in a 2 person household however i drink lots of fluids so use bathroom quite a bit on some days so maybe why we get up to 57 days per stamp max in the main bathroom i only use these in we rebuy this dispenser every month so basically we only get 45 weeks out of a dispenser of 6 stamps for under 4 and not having to complete the most hated job of scrubbing a nasty toilet every week now i am quite content even though i do not get even close to the stated up to 12 days per stamp i think they should be advertising the length of these based on flushes from a basic nonsaving water toilet which based on our experience is about 30 per glob which depends on how big the hmm stamp aka glob of gel decides to be

scent is very noticeable but not as strong after first day of sticking a new stamp around 3rd day you barely notice it i get sinus headaches from scents and have no issue with this one at all

my main issue with this is actually with the dispenser it is very hard to push button down so you can push to dispense glob stamp out i have to use a tool to push down button and start dispensing gel before i can go stick it in toilet bowl",-,bad,-,-,bad

overall pretty good gloves i have very small hands ring size 4 and they fit well everywhere except for the fingers the gloves are a bit too short in that respect so the part of the glove where the fingers meet the hand is a little high and not quite touching the webbing of my fingers which is a bit annoying but otherwise i would recommend seem pretty durable  i mainly use them to give my dog his immunosuppressant which he takes daily and so i dont go through the gloves too quickly i use the same pair repeatedly and no rips or tears,-,very good,-,-,very good
these gloves are a great price for everyday use i love that they are latex free powder free and i dont need them to be sterile because i just use them to protect my hands when using cleaning solutions chemicals hair coloring handling foods dirty packages etc i need small gloves and these fit quite well  a little on the bigger side but better than most i have tried its hard to find an xsmall so these work fine and the price is super low i havent had any rip or tear yet so i would say they are definitely good quality im very satisfied with the purchase of these brand of vinyl glove  i have had no irritation to my hands and they have stayed on while i have used them,very good,very good,-,very good,very good

when the description said double density im not sure what i had in mind about durability it certainly wasnt the product breaking into pieces after only a few minutes of scrubbing with them on the positive side they work really well even if theyre in pieces and there are so many in the package it doesnt feel like youre tossing money in the trash if you decide to throw it away i went on a maniacal testing spree when i got them and can say that they work well on most hard surfaces and if you use them dry which you arent supposed to they clean up pet hair off furniture like nobodys business if you want extended durability this isnt a great match for you the quantity and cost offsets the durability issue in my opinion,good,good,good,good,good
they degrade a little faster than the brand name and tend to leave chalky dust stuck to the surface youre cleaning so plan to wipe with a wet cloth when youre done overall though better value than the brand name and just as effective still a mild abrasive so always spot test what youre cleaning to make sure you wont damage it just like the brand name cleans like magic in the right application,very good,-,-,-,very good
these things work just as good as the name brand and will remove stuff that a simple wet rag and towel wont  however they do seem to be a bit less durable and they come apart/tear somewhat easier than the name brand  however for the price of the size pack of these and how many you get you cannot go wrong buying these whatsoever n i will definitely buy them again  highly recommended imo,very good,very good,-,-,very good

"these are great for getting fuzz pet hair lint dandruff etc off of fabric things like clothes furniture tablecloths etc i use them all the time  but i use them for more than fabric here are my top 10 tips

tip 1 if you have a felted type of fabric sometimes wool coats are like this or pool tables and the lint/hair usually pet hair gets almost woven into the fabric rolling the sticker thing on the paddle doesnt work that well and creates static i usually tear a clean sheet off completely and press it firmly onto the fabric then peel it off it seems to grab better for those embedded type of hairs

tip 2 broken glass i often roll it over my tile floor if i drop a glass just so i can pick up any possible shard of glass i initially pick up the big stuff by hand and i vacuum too later but the beater bar in my vacuum sometimes makes stuff fly so i do this before that

tip 3 these also work really well for dusting fabric lampshades you can either roll it or peel one off and use it like a sticky wipe

tip 4 getting crap out of drawers sometimes i clean out my desk drawers at work probably not often enough and there are little bits of stuff in there i dont know what it is but you can wipe them all into a pile and pick them up with a sheet of this without having to take out the drawer if you can even figure out how to do that on some desks

tip 5 picking up dead bugs and even some live ones i seem to get stink bugs in the fall in my attic room so i keep these around to pick them up i dont want to touch them and they say the live ones emit the stink when they are grabbed which apparently attracts more so encasing them in the plastic like sheet of these can help catch that

tip 6 cleaning out hard to reach spaces ever get crumbs in your pocket or purse? i dont carry cookies around on a regular basis but sometimes lint or something weird will get in my pocket and who wants to pick it out piece by piece? all pockets dont turn inside out just shove a sheet of this in there and grab that crap

tip 7 glitter anyone who has ever used glitter for anything knows it goes everywhere wiping it just seems to spread it and it sticks to tables even better if you try to use a damp cloth these pick it up in a second and for my relatives you know who you are who like to pour that glitter stuff into greeting cards so when you open the envelope it falls all over the place? then it sticks to your shoes and bare feet and generally hides through your whole house?  i win

tip 8 for dusting anything that cant get wet covers on speakers vents on computers car dashboards etc i sometimes even fold these sticky side out and slide them between keys on my laptop to get out crap that canned air works well too but i dont always have it

tip 9 okay this one is a little gross but did you ever get a sunburn and peel? and it isnt that fun peel where it comes off in like a sheet but rather little bits that just sort of look icky? i run these over my skin to get off the pieces i suppose if you have dry flaky skin in the winter or something why not?

tip 10 any small stuff that you want to grab spilled sugar in your cabinet knocked over cupcake sprinkles on your counter i hold beads on a sheet of this not just spilled ones but when i am working with them you can lay them out on it and pick up one at a time with your needle you can find a dropped contact with one if i am repairing jewelry or eyeglasses i will put the little parts on one to keep them from rolling away

"wool dryer balls  smart sheep 6pack  xl premium natural fabric softener awardwinning  wool balls replaces dryer sheets  wool balls for dryer  laundry balls for dryer

my wife did a lot of research on dryer balls that she wanted to try she picked wool dryer balls  smart sheep 6pack  xl premium i wasnt sure how tennis looking balls in the dryer could keep the sheets untangled and cut the electric usage

prior to her buying them we timed a load of towels and a load of sheets when the wool dryer balls arrived she was ready with the same load of towels very impressive they cut the drying time 40 on both the towels and the sheets the sheets use to tangle and therefore take a longer time to dry not anymore the time has been cut

i imagine over time the saving on a 220v dryer electricity usage will pay for the wool dryer balls i asked her if the actually softened the towels and sheets and she said it definitely did

as time goes along if they need to be replaced we will buy this brand again",-,very good,very good,-,very good
"absolutely wash these you wont regret it

i couldnt wait for these to arrive id been coveting them for months i had a few bottles of essential oils knocking around in my dresser drawer that were about to pass their prime it was the perfect time to order my very own wool dryer balls and finish off my almost expired bottles of essential oils

first impressions
no amount of essential oil was going to mask the distinct odor of sheep i was heartbroken i did a little research ok maybe more than a little and learned that the odor was typical and would fade in time in time? i wasnt about to dry load after load waiting for the scent of fleur de fleece to subside i took a chance and threw them in the washing machine  best idea ever wish it was mine after three washes with hot water and detergent they were significantly better i was afraid washing them may ruin them but it didnt i made a blend of lemon oil lavender oil and a little distilled water in a spray bottle and generously sprayed them before tossing them in the dryer with some towels hallelujah the sheepstink was gone but i could barely detect my lavenderlemon blend i put away the spray bottle and drop by drop i added the oils directly to the wool balls to be exact 9 drops lavender and 10 drops lemon per wool ball i placed them in a large glass jar and let them marinate for a few hours im on my fifth load and my laundry still smells amazing i havent even removed the wool balls from the dryer i just let all six of them hang out waiting for the next load of wet laundry

my other concern was whether or not my darks would be covered in wool lint a couple of reviews had me worried i just dried my first load of darks and im thrilled to say there is no wool lint on any of my veryemodaughters clothing i never would have heard the end of that i think washing the wool balls first prevented them from shedding lint

overall im pretty happy with these they truly do cut down on drying time and im not having any static cling issues if you do have static cling you could attach a safety pin to one of the wool balls or throw in a waded up ball of foil just dont over dry your laundry and the static should ease up im anxious to try another blend dont you just love fresh scented laundry? breathe it in eyes roll back and lids flutter aahhhhh

best wishes to anyone who does their familys laundry youre a superwoman or a superman or a superperson

update
it has been two weeks and im still happy with my sheep wool balls ive added a couple photos so you can see how theyre holding up the wool balls are discolored from essential oils but i expected that

additionally in my sincerest attempt to sound humble whats with the tennis balls?
i thought the main idea of wool balls was to cut down drying time and ditch the dryer sheets containing chemicals tennis balls are made from rubber and a thin layer of wool sometimes nylon that doesnt seem like enough wool to aid in drying besides i wouldnt want hot rubber in my dryer with my laundry maybe im wrong perhaps im missing something? id much rather shell out a few more bucks for 100 wool solely wool i just may eat all my words before long it looks like some folks wool balls are unraveling? drat

update 2  i know im a nerd
its been nearly six months and theyre still going strong occasionally i toss them in the washing machine to keep our darks lint free theyre keeping their shape and doing their job",-,very good,very good,very good,very good
not sure how but i saw a few people talking about how these things cut down on dry time  so i experimented  instead of using high heat i choose the more economical low heat setting and put these 5 balls in there  strangely enough the clothes were done in about half the amount of time on the low setting  not sure how or why nor do i care cause it works  we bought some different essential oils that we drip onto the dryer balls which means we were able to cut down on buying dryer sheets,bad,bad,bad,-,bad
i have been using these for over a year now and will never go back to dryer sheets i was spending over 8 every couple of months to buy dryer sheets after trying to reduce my waste and cut back costs i decided to try dryer balls while there is a transition period i have not looked back these reduce my drying time creates air pockets as the clothes dry and keep my towels and other clothes soft the one complaint i have about these is they come packaged in plastic and really would appreciate if they wouldnt after a year of use i am anticipating getting another year out of them as they are still in good shape i only use three at a time for reference i am still on the original three i dont like to add essential oils to them but the nice thing about dryer balls is if you like fragrance you can add essential oils to them i know several people who do and have good luck and love it but i personally prefer to keep these fragrance free,very good,very good,very good,very good,very good
my husband has skin problems so looked for something other than dryer sheets wow these wool balls are not only chemical free but they actually help to dry the clothes quicker no wrinkles and feel softer a slight animal smell when you first use them but did not transfer to the clothes after a couple uses its gone,-,neutral,-,-,neutral
unlike other dryer balls purchased in the past these do not have the pilling issue when drying towels or other highpile items solid well felted and a weight to them work great for softening the clothes and preventing wrinkles only issue  the damn dog haunts the laundry room running off with whatever falls out of the dryer and these are the golden goose forget the leave it command  only way to save the dognapped item is to trade for a high value treat if you dont notice shes snagged a dryer ball then you might as well kiss it goodbye because youll find it flayed apart rip sheepie,very good,very good,-,-,very good
these are awesome i was having a problem possibly an old worn out dryer where all my clothes were wrinkly all the time no matter how quickly i got them out of the dryer i dont like to iron judge me if you want throwing a few of these things in there resolved that issue plus as a bonus i dont need to add dryer sheets in any more either,-,-,good,-,good

"it came opened untaped and unassembled so hopefully i didnt touch anyones you know what putting this thing together

lots of people with weird reviews are like its too soft its too short my thingy didnt close

so let me say its a new plunger if you are expecting an old school hard plunger from the 70s this is not for you it works well if you screw the handle into the head until you cant possibly screw it in anymore if its all loosey goosey its going to be weird when you use it

its not too short idk its normal plunger length its not a broom handle but like its an adequate plunger handle length

the holder is great mine closes and opens as it should its got a little drain thingy for drips to go a lot of people were mad in their reviews that all the water goes in there and like how much water are you really getting in there? what are you doing wrong? are you not shaking it off first before you put it back in the holder? youre just going toilet to caddy in one motion? if you do that then yeah youre def gonna have water otherwise its a drip catch that you can easily lysol because idk anyone who is going to actually pick that up and clean it regularly

this is my second one i cant find this one in stores anywhere around so im glad i could find it here its a plunger it plunges",-,very good,-,-,very good
our powder room needed a refresh so i ordered a couple of new toilet items we had an old fashioned read ugly plunger and i wanted to have a more stylish one for this guest facility it definitely is pretty but when we tested it on a minor clog it wasnt as effective as the bigger old fashioned one we used for years it eventually got the job done so well keep it but for serious clogs stuff happens i will keep the old one in the  basement just in case,-,neutral,-,-,neutral

tbh im just happy i could find something in amazon home goods that isnt by some unknown company called zwkrevyt or whatever it works,-,very good,-,-,very good
the plunger itself is good but i bought it for the cover no one wants that dirty plunger on the ground and half of the cover broke off after about a week we still use it but its a bummer i wish that was made sturdier if i could have returned it i would have like the idea but needs to be more durable,-,bad,-,bad,bad
setup was easy unpack and screw the head onto the handle but every time i used it the head collapsed i was expecting it to rebound to its original shape so i could push it down fully again instead i had to lift it to the rim and pop it back into shape,-,good,good,-,good
"i recently purchased duracell optimum double a batteries for my household devices and i have been very impressed with their performance the batteries have a longlasting power that outlasts other brands i have tried in the past

i particularly appreciate the duracell optimums advanced technology that provides extra life in highdrain devices like my wireless gaming controller and digital camera these batteries also have a storage life of up to 10 years which means i can stock up on them without worrying about them losing their power over time

another great feature of these batteries is their convenient storage packaging the resealable packaging makes it easy to store them and prevents them from getting lost or damaged

overall i am extremely satisfied with my purchase of duracell optimum double a batteries they are reliable longlasting and have exceeded my expectations i highly recommend these batteries to anyone looking for highquality reliable power for their devices",-,very good,very good,very good,very good

what i like about this product is that it is 100 effective somehow i let it sit around for the better part of the year because i thought it had a shampoo texture when in fact it has a very thin watery texture this does not at all diminish its efficacy i whipped it out to try to remove a set in grape juice stain that remained after i had my carpet professionally steam cleaned i was so disappointed after the professional cleaning because not only was the carpet still filthy some of the stains remained to my astonishment i poured some of this product directly on the stain and immediately lifted the stain with a paper towel i use bounty i think its the best it is so absorbent anyways after that went so amazingly well i decided to try to see if it would lift some dirt too  the problem that we have been having is that dirt had accumulated on the edges of our pale area carpet because the edges are hard to vacuum and shampoo along the edges i pour the solution directly on the dirt waited a couple of seconds and then lifted the dirt with bounty my carpet  im so sorry i did not make a video but you can physically see the dirt that has been lifted on the bounty so i pretty much repeated this procedure until there was no more dirt showing up on my paper towel my husband was upset that i went through about six rolls of bounty  but as i pointed out the cost for six rolls of paper towels is so much less than the hundreds of dollars that we spent on the professional carpet cleaning i should also add that the carpet edges especially were really dirty  are used a different shampoo a regular shampoo from hoover and bought a carpet cleaner  from hoover and that did not clean this carpet  then came covid  then we got the professional steam cleaning then i discovered this fantastic product  so far it has removed concorde grape juice stains that had been set in crayola “washable” marker and deep set dirt all along the edges  im repurchasing and im going to use it in my hoover steam cleaner  hopefully that will work as well as lifting the stains manually with paper towels  i dont see how anyone could be disappointed with this product its practically magic,bad,bad,bad,bad,bad
i wish i thought to take before pictures so that i could compare to the end result  this stuff took out stains that had been in my carpet for at least 2 years  i used this along with a hoover pet xl carpet cleaner  i purchased them at the same time  using this with the machine set to deep clean produced amazing results on my living room carpet  i have ordered the 128oz just today to clean other areas  it really does clean  restore  the carpet looks just as good maybe better than the day i moved in,-,very good,very good,-,very good

"what an interesting product  from the product pictures i thought that the jeymei 4pack damp clean duster sponge had an interesting design with its ridges and halfrounded shape  i thought that the ridges would really help to clean bathroom surfaces as each ridge provides more surface area for cleaning  i also expected each of the valleys between ridges to be able to pick up little crumbs

well when i received the item i found that i was right about the design but what i was surprised about was the actual material that this sponge is made of

each of the sponges in this 4pack come individually wrapped in plastic in order to keep the sponge soft  as indicated on the box if the sponge dries out just like normal sponge just soak it again to make it soft

what makes this sponge different is that it feels amost like memory foam or those squishies/mochi toys  the air bubbles in the sponge are really really small and because of this i found that the sponge can hold a lot of water in it making it great for cleaning up water spills

as i expected the shape of the sponge makes it easy to hold and the ridges helps to clean up counters effectively  the ability to absorb a lot of water means that its effective in making the surface wet for cleaning then squeeze out the sponge and you can then use it to clean and pick up the dirty water  finish up the job with a driy towel and youre done",-,very good,-,very good,very good
i love these sponges i saw the name brand ones on tiktok brand rhymes with shrub caddy and rushed to amazon to buy one then i saw that the only brand named ones available on amazon were definitely being sold for more than the msrp and they were completely sold out on the “shrub caddy” website in the interest of not being gouged i took a chance on these when they had no reviews im glad i did they are great and work really well for removing dust and even wiping up small messes they do arrive predampened but dont worry theres no mildew or smell when they dry out they get super hard but again dont worry just soak in warm water and they go back to normal so far ive only opened one of my four pack and ive been using it for a couple of months im guessing one box will last me over a year i might even give one away to a friend since they are individually wrapped im glad i bought them and highly recommend,-,very good,-,very good,very good
this product does exactly what it says it does it traps dust and then you rinse it away i love it works great im really excited about it and really happy it works ive only used it once so far and i hope they hold up for a long time i bought a 4 pack and it feels durable im so happy i wont be pushing dust around anymore that was something that always got on my nerves with a regular rag,-,very good,very good,-,very good
this cleaning sponge duster made dusting easier and quicker the suits in the sponge really grabs the dust and holds it till you rinse it off as compared to most other dusters that just fluff the dust into the air i will definitely buy it again,-,-,-,-,-

you get 50 of these things neatly packaged i like using multiple wipes for surfaces so theres no spreading or cross contamination across surfaces theyre not the thickest things in the world but theyre sturdy and much more absorbent than youd expect for their thinness i like spraying my bleach mixture straight onto my rags and then wiping it dont run down and absorbed it all well not all microfiber cloths absorb much at all and the fuzzy side of these did much better than the amazon basics did which i used for several years honestly theyre not the biggest thing the world but id absolutely take 50 of these over 24 of amazons,-,very good,-,very good,very good
i use microfiber cloths for just about every cleaning chore i do these are a good size and come in pretty colors not that it matters theyre just cheerful to look at theyre a little bit thinner than other towels ive bought but theyre much cheaper than the thicker ones and they do the job just fine like them especially for cleaning windows nd any other surfaces that tend otherwise to show streaks,very good,very good,-,-,very good

"i recently acquired an electric lighter specifically designed for candles and it has truly transformed my candle lighting experience in the past i often struggled with traditional lighters due to difficulties reaching candles in tight or hardtoreach areas as well as challenges posed by wind blowing out the flame fortunately these challenges are now a thing of the past

the lighters design is both sleek and stylish fitting comfortably in my hand and being effortless to use the long flexible neck of the lighter has also proved invaluable enabling me to reach into deep candle holders or jars without burning my fingers the neck is also bendable making it convenient to angle the lighter in the correct direction

however the true highlight of this lighter is its electric ignition with just the press of a button the lighter generates a spark that instantaneously and effortlessly lights the candle it eliminates the need to worry about running out of lighter fluid or dealing with matches that break or fail to light correctly the electric lighter also removes any concern of burning oneself or accidentally starting a fire as it does not produce a flame

moreover the electric lighter is environmentally friendly and costeffective as it is rechargeable charging the lighter is as simple as plugging it in and it is ready for use again in no time

overall i am incredibly satisfied with my electric lighter for candles it has simplified and enhanced my candle lighting experience the design is userfriendly and stylish the electric ignition is quick and dependable and the rechargeable feature is an added advantage i highly recommend this product to anyone who loves candles or desires a more comfortable and safer way to light them in my opinion it deserves a 5star rating",very good,very good,very good,very good,very good

i was using the cascade and finish dishwasher packs however there were several times they did not completely break down during the dishwasher cycle i have a brand new dish washer so i figured i would purchase these gel pacs and give them a try they work so much better and my dishes come out sparkling clean i hope they continue to make these because the gel breaks down and no more worries about pieces left over,-,very good,very good,-,very good

when i informed them that they still were not working they immediately replaced them   almost two years after i purchased them

for some reason the sound of this absolutely terrifies my cat i went to light a candle and he went flying across the room he ran so fast he skidded and body slammed the corner of the wall to escape the room ive used it 2 other times since and he immediately runs off poor guy wont even come into the family room now needless to say i wont be using it again great lighter though,-,poor,poor,-,poor
the one i purchased worked terrifically its not easy lighting a candle with big hands and a small lighter so i went and bought this doodad i loved it and used it to light candles left and right however a few days ago it wouldnt hold a charge id charge it to full and then light one 3 wick candle and its dead again i thought maybe i left it off the charger too long? nope mere seconds after pulling it off the charger with a full charge it dies again so be wary about battery life when purchasing this other than that its pretty nifty smiling face with sunglasses,-,very good,-,-,very good

so far i like this product just push it up and press the button to light i would say keep this away from children for obvious reasons even though the process of pushing the switch up and pressing the button would be difficult for a young child it is still dangerous and isnt childproof completely i like that the charge is displayed upon opening it up my one issue is the charging input is slightly off so well see how it charges also it is a little difficult to get a wick to light  in the video i was using my left hand but had to switch to my right dominant to get a good light and held it for a few seconds before it lit completely,-,very good,very good,-,very good
i love the rechargeable feature but the setup is a little hard to light certain things you have to get your object inbetween two prongs to light it so sometimes this wont work well candles are easy to light same with grills,-,very good,very good,-,very good
bought it in february and by april the battery no longer charges the whole thing gets really hot when you try to charge it and after cleaning the contacts thinking that was the problem turns out the battery is just no longer holding a charge not great that its just after the return period not super enthused but you get what you pay for,-,bad,bad,-,bad

"i recently picked up a suprus electric lighter and let me tell you this thing is a gamechanger gone are the days of fumbling with traditional lighters or struggling to get that perfect candle flame  all it takes is a quick swipe of the plasma arch and voila almost an instant ignition  almost because sometimes it takes few seconds for the candle to lit up 

use
the best part is that its so easy to use  all you have to do is hold the lighter close to what you want to light and the plasma arch does the rest plus the builtin battery can be easily recharged via usbc so youll never have to worry about running out of lighter fluid or replacing batteries

durability
in terms of durability ive been using my suprus multiple times a day for the past week and its still going strong its also very lightweight and easy to hold making it the perfect tool for lighting candles incense or even a bbq some people complain about battery life lasting only a few uses either they have a bad unit or simply those are bad reviews from a competition since i got it a few months ago i say i use it about 46 times a week and i still havent recharged the unit

the bad
minus one star although it is made of aluminum i still feel like it is a bit cheap and not as durable as i had hoped keep in mind however that it is a budgetfriendly option at only 10 so its important not to have too high of expectations

overall
im thrilled with my purchase its convenient easy to use and has quickly become my goto lighter if youre tired of fumbling with traditional lighters or just want a more modern and efficient way to light things i highly recommend giving this one a try",very good,very good,very good,-,very good

"ive read some of the negative reviews and i had to come in and leave a review of my own because these things are amazing youve heard best thing since sliced bread? this is what theyre talking about if you want to save time skip the review and just buy them now youre welcome

yes theyre weird and crunchy and dont dry flat thats true these arent something you set out to look pretty for company theyre a tool in your cleaning tool box and you should have a cleaning toolbox because thats how that works cleaning is a job and its completely undervalued as such lets get to it

these arent for scrubbing need to scrub? use a rag or a razor or a scouring pad think glass top stove sometimes you need a razor spill flour or something powdery? grab one of these they pick up everything and thats nice and all its more than nice they do a remarkable job but more magic comes in when you rinse them nothing gums up they rinse right off very quickly so you can keep going no fibers for things to embed in wiping a wood table after dinner? they grab every single crumb and none of those streaks of water a rag leaves that is a stunning feat they hold the perfect amount of moisture they can be as wet or dry as the job youre doing requires i love them on stainless appliances inside of the refrigerator they hold enough heat from warm water and enough moisture to dissolve smeared stuff kids leave on the doors its fast i have them in my bathroom for quick wipe downs or pre wipe downs before a deeper clean its an extra step but it saves time because it picks up every piece of lint or dust mirrors windows best things ever polish/dry with rag/paper towel of choice i used them the other day to do a little deeper dusting of furniture ever so slightly damp went crazy the other day with them and hit my washer and dryer im obsessed with them and not just any brand these these are the ones i e experimented get these

my coffee maker okay this is important i can get this so so soapy wet let the soap and water do its thing solvent right? then rinse and wring this out and it picks all of that right back up all of the little bitty corners so clean a rag can not do that

are they going to stain? yeah they are theyre a tool they arent for high tea i wouldnt use them to scour that would be like using a tooth brush where you need an orbital sander there has to be some understanding of what tool a job requires cmon now

they are a workhorse for what they do into chemical free/product free cleaning? im telling you cleaning is what i do wet one of these and hit a mirror with just water these are to clean the mirror not polish clean stainless polish/dry stainless with microfiber i have a very specific paper towel i polish/dry a mirror with but its fast and time matters for all of us

little knickknacks? whoa just try them  ill be thinking of things all day i should have listed in here

throw them in the dishwasher or washer i dont put them in the dryer and they last  i cant tell you how many times ive bought these as gifts im back to buy more to give out and everyone ive bought them for has done the same ive bought more for myself and not because i need more they hold up but because i want more i have them stashed everywhere bathrooms laundry room kitchen car

just try them these this brand if you regret the purchase you arent appreciating the properties of the tool and arent matching the tool to the task these are brilliant they just are never quit making them i bet theres a fan club forum somewhere for them like there is the instant pot

absorbency ack i havent even touched on that magic obviously if you drop a 2 liter grab a towel  match the tool to the task the ability to control how wet or damp this thing can be not be overlooked or understated as an important component it may be the most important element

splashes or smudges on painted drywall? a rag will burn the paint these glide if this doesnt get it off you were going to have to touch it up anyway thats just a fact

they stain oh that made me laugh are you kidding? good grief who cares? they wash clean  a stain isnt the same as holding germs and bacteria they arent dinner linens sorry but that blew my mind as a complaint all i could think is are you new?

try them if you think theyre junk take one to your mom or your grandma and have them show you how to clean its actually a skill and these should be in your toolbox",very good,very good,very good,very good,very good
"so there are some downsides as others mentioned they dry all weird almost like a taco but aside from that they are insanely durable clean easily scrub the counters well and have saved me from losing my mind every time my wife walks in with another costco paper towel purchase id say these have lowered our paper towel usage by 80 most of all they are soft when wet so the kiddos dont mind their faces being scrubbed after dinner thats a win for me

these reusable paper towels are weird  i really like using them for making espresso because my machine flings espresso all over so i hold one of these up to catch the droplets  i read a review that said do not machine wash these so i rinsed one and laid it out to dry  it dried all wrinkly and is not very flexible now  it is still super absorbent though and i will use this one until it gets too gross because i am not using it to clean or anything  i like the idea of not wasting a paper towel every time i use my espresso machine,-,very good,very good,-,very good
since first purchasing these several years ago they are the only cloth that i use in the kitchen and bathroom i am constantly wiping counters appliances etc even with constant use and abuse they last for several months i wash them with my other towels then let them air dry they dry quickly and never sour my only complaint is that a large portion of them are now white which i dont like they discolor much more easily,-,bad,-,-,bad
i am absolutely in love with these wipes i have 2 kids under 5 who make big messes all the time it took a while to get in the habit of using these and not paper towels but i got a simple napkin holder to store them in and set them right next to the paper towels and that really helped these have cut down our paper towels usage by about 90 and they absorb 100 better than even the best name brand paper towels ive bought i use paper towels only for drying meat or cleaning up really gross/germy messes that i wouldnt believe i could get clean after after i use them they hang in my laundry which is right next to my kitchen so its convenient for me until dry and then i wash them with the rest of my towels and cleaning cloths with no fabric softener and then lay flat to dry pop them back in the napkin holder and away we go and when they inevitably get too dirty or because my husband uses them on something he shouldnt they go in the trash and i dont feel guilty because theyre biodegradable ive purchased at least 3 packs in different colors and am cutting up some of the most recent pack to make reusable face wipes for toner i really cant say enough good things about these,-,very good,very good,-,very good
i love this product but the dye they used to turn them pink was bleeding out of the cloth when i tried to use it for the first time i have a white sink so it was very noticeable the photo is of the water after i soaked the cloths overnight i had to wash them and rinse them several times before they stopped bleeding i still love the product just wish i would have chosen a different color / white,-,very good,very good,-,very good
i like that they absorb well  dry fast i bought these because the reviews said there was no smell after washing there was a slight smell after i washed one in the washing machine i will wash the next one in the dishwasher to see if there is still a smell,-,-,-,-,-
honestly i almost passed these up the add i where i originally saw these featured reminded me somewhat of a 90s infomercial but the cost was very reasonable so i gave em a shot turns out theyre exactly how they were described soft flexible super absorbent and very durable even after you run them through the washing machine and dryer they hold up and dont tear or fray especially if youve got a busy household or pets a couple packs of these could last at least a year,very good,very good,very good,-,very good

"as someone who uses aluminum foil frequently in the kitchen i have been very happy with the amazon basics aluminum foil this 250 sq ft roll is a great value and has held up well for all of my cooking and baking needs

one of the standout features of this aluminum foil is its thickness it is strong and durable making it suitable for a variety of tasks such as wrapping food for storage lining baking sheets or covering dishes to keep food warm

i appreciate that the roll is long enough to last for many uses and the cutter on the box makes it easy to tear off the desired amount of foil without struggling with sharp edges the box also has a sturdy construction and is easy to dispense from

another great feature of this aluminum foil is that it is versatile and can be used for both hot and cold foods i have used it to wrap sandwiches and leftovers cover dishes in the oven and even to make foil packets for grilling

it is a highquality product at a great value and it has held up well for all of my cooking and baking needs i highly recommend it to anyone looking for a reliable and affordable aluminum foil option",very good,very good,-,very good,very good

did i really believe this would work? no but i tried everything from a full blown carpet cleaner to scrubbing with dish soap and the two stains on my livingroom rug and nothing had helped this got good reviews so i figured it was worth a try before buying a new rug holy cow within literally seconds the stains were gone i so wish i had done beforeafter pics or a video i rarely do reviews but this worked so well i had to share it fwiw  its a white area rug with blue stripes there were two small grey stains on the white area with two cats three boys and a dog no idea what the origin of the stains was but this worked,-,very good,-,-,very good

"i have been using these filters with my mocca master for 2 years now and theyre some of the best filters out there i do not notice a change in taste at all and theyre very highquality as well as easy to use i also use a circle cutter and use these filters as a bottomfilter for my portafilter  espresso machine this helps filter some of the natural residue present while making an espresso

the only issue with these filters is not with the actual filters itself but the fact that they cost 25x more here versus the actual mocca master website because of the huge price increase i would recommend purchasing it at mocca masters actual website as you can save up to 56 per box the filters by itself are 5/5 but because of the price i give it a 4/5

definitely recommend for anyone using a mocca master",very good,very good,very good,very good,very good
i bought a mocchamaster for my fiancé in the philippines and own 2 myself i almost purchased x4 of the filters which would have cost 5492 with my prime account normally when you factor in shipping it is the same to purchase either through amazon or the manufacturer but on this occasion i bought the same x4 of the 100 x 4 filters 400 filters in total about 125 days worth  lol with tax and shipping for 3512so not even close on the price i prefer these filters to other brands as they fit the filter better and dont alter the taste of the coffee i brew,very good,-,very good,-,very good

i have been buying reynolds wrap for years and the aluminum foil itself is as good as it gets my recurring problem is that the box ends easily come unglued happens a lot if your not careful the roll will slip out and hit the floor which deforms the end and makes it difficult to unroll the remainder of the foil without it tearing this could be easily fixed by using more then just a spot of glue on each end of the box the bigger rolls do get heavy i have taken to adding staples for reinforcement as soon as i open a new roll make sure to the smooth/flat side of the staple is on the inside of the box or youll have other problems,-,neutral,-,neutral,neutral

other people seem to be fine using these for epoxy resin so im not sure if this skin reaction is from chemical exposure or if im allergic to the gloves ive been using them for a while but usually i wear them for 20 minutes or less at a time when i take them off my fingers dont feel sticky but they have been slightly itchy and irritated in the past a week and a half ago i wore the gloves for 5ish hours a few pairs throughout the day not just one while using uv resin to make earrings im a lot less messy with this stuff and hardly get it on the gloves at all but for some reason i woke up in the middle of the night with burning itchy fingers and they all looked like this im still recovering from this and my skin feels so sensitive  dry and im not 100 sure what to blame  if youre a resin artist you might want to look for thicker gloves just to be safe idk what i would be allergic to in these but thats the explanation that makes more sense to me woman shrugging im still giving 4 stars though because theyre e probably fine for most people and its not the gloves fault if im just allergic lol,-,poor,poor,poor,poor

ive been buying nonscratch sponges right and left trying to find some that my arthritic hands can handle  they were all too stiff  the sshaped ones added another layer of impossibility as did the natural material ones which can give you splinters  this was going to be my last try before giving up  i love them  i will use this kind until they quit making them  im so thankful to the reviewer who said they were soft  i didnt rate scent because there isnt any and i dont know about durability yet but i dont care about that,-,very good,-,-,very good
"these sponges impressed me right away as most sponges of this type blue nonscratch are very stiff and firm for the first week you start using them ungainly and difficult to work with around tight corners inside cups etc  these sponges had a soft brokenin feel that made them usable right away and still very solid feeling and they stay somewhat soft when dry
  ever since dawn came out with their wedge sponges i liked the slight taper so every sponge ive bought since 10 years? gets about a 1/2  of taper with a pair of scissors it is a slight angle cut but surprisingly adds a lot of comfort to the hand and a bit more usability washing glasses and cups try it yourself
  time will tell if this initial softness will add or detract from long term durability though i probably do more damage myself to my sponges cleaning knives than from general use  i will definitely be buying more with this price and performance
followup after about a month my first sponge started showing signs of wear and separation around the edges but only around the edges still stayed strong until about midmay that is about 2 months of daily use and still was usable until i swapped it out for a new one and again i was impressed with how the new one was ready to go right away not stiff like almost every other sponge i tried i absolutely love these never had sponges work so well and be as durable",very good,very good,very good,-,very good
ive been using these for over a month now and they are good they do start to fall apart but after some serious use they clean well and are gentle on my favorite pots they dont scratch easily unless i really apply pressure to it,-,very good,-,-,very good

these arent bad but my biggest issue with these sponges is durability  in particular the scrubber portion of the sponge wears out easily and starts to unravel after the first couple of uses  they definitely do not hold up like the 3m or scotch brand sponges however they are less expensive which is why i gave them a try  the sponge part is very good as it holds water / absorbs well and is more durable than the scrubber part  the sponge part also wrings out pretty good and does not grow mold / mildew easily,very good,very good,-,-,very good

had one of those old oxo soap dish scrubbers and was doing okay with it until it started leaking soap and then broke at the handle which a lot of those seem to do after reading reviews needed a replacement and got the scotchbrite dish scrubber and already i think its doing a better job they advertise it as leak proof so far that seems to be the case when you fill it up with dish soap and screw the handle back on it seems very tight tighter than the oxo handle was and nothings leaking out so already i think its better constructed also the bristles seem stiffer so maybe that means it wont wear as fast it has replaceable heads just like the oxo so far so good no problems would recommend this over oxo,-,very good,-,-,very good
ive use many products similar to this before and this is the first one that the dish soap does not leak out it squirts out when you push the button very accurately and there is no mess ive been very pleased with this and will reorder another one in the future,-,neutral,-,-,neutral
"have used this for a week and here are my thoughts everything positive
i like the overall design its simple easy to refill bristle length is perfect not too stiff but not too flimsy either handle is comfortable ergonomic and lightweight but it doesnt feel cheap havent been abusing it so i dont know if it would break if i dropped it on the floor but i like it too much to do that lol
hasnt cracked or showed any signs of leaking soap dispenses when you push the button not alot but thats ok with me because id rather conserve soap than have too much coming out
i like how the handle is far enough from the bristles that you dont have to get your hands wet to clean dishes which is nice because i have eczema on my right hand that gets aggravated with repeated exposure to hot water so its helped with that
bristles could be just a little stiffer in my opinion but thats not a big deal to me we dont have a dishwasher so we do all our dishes in the sink i try to get to my dishes before the mess gets dried and it takes more scrubbing i havent run into a dish this thing cant clean yet just takes more scrubbing

overall great brush highly recommend",very good,very good,-,very good,very good

"i originally bought two of these to have for general cleaning of the car and around the house little did i know how popular they were going to be i have had to buy more not once but twice now these buckets are so versatile so handy two five now just wasnt enough
they are large enough to get a goof amount of water for whatever job is at hand a sturdy handle makes lifting and carrying a snap even if you may not have a specific purpose in mind having these will present opportunity to use them",-,very good,-,-,very good
"this sturdy bucket holds 3 gallons of vinegar plus the submerged pump adequately for thrushing the tankless water heater its rectangular dimension allowed me to tilt the pump sideways to remove bubbles and start the flow a round bucket may not allow that tilting as easily one has to be careful not to spill the liquid which is eaxy from this small bucket but it did the job very well
an afterthought is that the blue bucket made it impossible to see the blue tint generated from the frush process a beige color bucket may be a better choice for this purpose
after 7 years of use at the low 126 degrees f there was hardly any significant scale generated to be removed by frushing even after frushing for 25 hours this is with city water with tds of 130150",-,very good,-,-,very good
just ordered two of these recently to help when cleaning my house  they are very sturdy high quality and im confident they will last me years  you can buy a cheaper bucket however the plastic generally will break on them quite easily and they wont last as long  if youre looking for quality i definitely recommend this product,very good,very good,-,-,very good
product arrived intact and in new condition  it holds the amount that was advertised  the color is uniform throughout  the wire handle is sturdy enough to hold some weight and the plastic on the handle allows you to more comfortably hold the bucket than if it was just the wire handle alone  the spout on either side allows you to pour from either direction which means i dont have to spin the bucket around to find the spout  the square shape is good for some applications  the bucket does not tip over easily,-,good,-,-,good
like the headline says its a bucket  5 stars,-,-,-,-,-
product quality is good and durable,-,good,-,-,good
its a pail  it holds soapy water and other liquid substances  it has a handle so you can carry your soapy water and other liquid substances around your house or out to your car  its light weight so you can tilt it upside down to empty it of the soapy water or other liquid substances,-,poor,-,-,poor

"1/29/2023 review still going strong update below

i love this amazer dish brush prior to this i was using the oxo good grips soap dispensing dish brush 12 but the bristles wouldnt last two weeks sometimes the amazer looks brand new after 50 days and the amazer is only 427 two for 854

sure i have to squirt soap on the bristles instead of press the oxo soap dispenser button but honestly it was a pain to keep filling up the oxo wand and the button stopped working on it after a while not to mention the replacement oxo bristles heads were 7 for 2 plus squirting soap on the amazer bristles is actually easier 

i really wanted to like the oxo as i love their other stuff but the amazer is so amazing ive started to use amazer as a verb a la google it this beer is amazer honey this dinner is amazer you hair looks amazer did you use our spare amazer to comb it?

these bristles are surely made by some alien technology the government got off a ufo at area 51 i will post again after another few years when the bristles have worn down a bit my kids are already fighting over who will get this amazer when i die none of them im taking it with me its already written into my will

this amazer dish brush has made me want to be a better human every day i wake up and look into the mirror and say be amazer today you can be amazer too for only 12 youll get two but you wont need them both because the bristles never wear out give one to a friend and make them amazer too

be well my friends

5/2/2023 update still going strong

ive bought two sets of these brushes and i can honestly say they are the best brushes ive ever found for scrubbing just about anything  the bristles are very effective on pots and and wood cutting boards  not too stiff and not too soft and the handle is angled just right to comfortably brush away whatever is stuck  and when even the bristles wont get the really stuck on stuff off theres always the scraper to give it the final heave ho   it seems a bit silly to describe something like a dish brush as delightful but it is a really satisfying product to use,-,very good,-,-,very good
these brushes get the job done solidly they are cost effective and easy to replace plus 2 at a time the best i use one until its too beat up then just swap it out once i do i order a new pair worth it and works well,very good,very good,very good,-,very good

"as a customer i am extremely happy with my purchase of the amazer dish brush with handle this product has made doing dishes a breeze and i no longer dread this household task

the brushes are very durable and the bristles are stiff making them perfect for scrubbing away even the toughest grime and food residue the handle is ergonomic and provides a comfortable grip making it easy to maneuver the brush while im cleaning

i also appreciate the fact that i received two brushes in the pack so i always have a backup on hand they are also easy to clean and dry so i dont have to worry about any bacteria or mold buildup

i have used these brushes on all types of kitchenware including pots pans and even my sink and they have worked wonders on every surface i love that they are environmentally friendly and made without any harsh chemicals which is important to me

overall i would highly recommend the amazer dish brush with handle to anyone looking for a durable and effective kitchen scrub brush they have made cleaning my kitchen so much easier and i am thrilled with my purchase",-,very good,-,-,very good

"i recently broke my dominant shoulder and found myself struggling to maintain my personal hygiene without assistance thats when i discovered these flushable wipes and they have been an absolute gamechanger for me

first of all i appreciate the fact that these wipes are flushable i am on a sceptic system i was hesitant to use them at first because i didnt want to cause any plumbing issues but these wipes dissolve quickly and easily in water this makes them not only convenient but also ecofriendly

the wipes themselves are gentle and effective providing a thorough clean without any irritation i was initially worried about any potential fragrances or chemicals in the wipes but they are hypoallergenic and free from harmful additives which is a huge plus  i even used them to wash my face a time or two

using these flushable wipes has made my life so much easier during my recovery period they are easy to use convenient to carry around and have helped me maintain a level of cleanliness that i would have struggled to achieve otherwise i highly recommend them to anyone who may be in a similar situation or anyone who is looking for a convenient and effective way to freshen up on the go

overall i would give these flushable wipes a 5star rating without hesitation they have truly been a lifesaver for me and i am so grateful to have found them",-,very good,very good,very good,very good
"i have tried many but these are my favorite wipes on the market in june i fell and sustained a spinal cord injury it is difficult for me to move by torso around while in a sitting position  these wipes are just thin enough and thick enough to clean very effectively  they are not flimsy
and  do not rip they have a nice light scent but nothing flowery or overwhelming  as with any manufactured product sometimes when you pull out a towelette more than one may come out but its very easy to separate them and push the other towelettes back into the opening which actually makes it more accessible for next time the plastic lid snaps shut nice and tight i gave them a 5 because i found no reason not to i am placing my 4th order today",-,-,very good,-,very good
"these wipes are absolutely awesome  theyre soft yet quite durable  they dont tear apart coming out of the pack or a dispenser and they do the job perfectly  the scent is just an appealing fresh scent thats not too overwhelming

i also find these great for throwing into a backpack / messenger bag to clean up on the go  the package they come in has its own sealed lid to dispense the wipes so its totally safe to have with you",-,-,-,very good,very good
these are so perfect they do the job and the iron strong there was every penny there are priced at such a great price for an eight pack of them i bought a eight pack of different ones last month because there were a few dollars cheaper and broke out all over where i use them i was allergic to them obviously and ive never been allergic to anything in my life so i will definitely never go to any other brand but these these are definite by i will definitely be buying them again,very good,very good,-,-,very good
i dont usually write a review for these types of products just give the appropriate star rating and leave it at that but these little cleansing cloths warrant a written review they provide just the right amount of extra cleansing and gives you a refreshing feeling leaves you feeling positive that you are not only squeaky clean but odor free as well nice little tushy cloths and flushable as well better than any others that i have tried and a great price non irritating highly recommend,very good,-,-,-,very good
i like these because theyre good for the septic system i love them however because they are gentle enough to even use on toddlers who are potty training so far weve had no allergic reaction almost every breaks out our children,-,very good,-,-,very good
theyre soft smell nice and are wide enough good for wiping your bottom but also works for wiping your face etc as well they are flushable but of course dont flush too many all at once love the lid to keep the wipes fresh and that plenty come in one pouch,-,very good,-,-,very good
ive bought other brands and sometimes due to how thin they are its difficult to just grab one or two out of the package because theyll tear these do not do that and yet theyre extremely thin i think its because they have the right amount of liquid that theyre packaged in they work very nicely without tearing or running liquid i wish they made a smaller pursesized option,-,good,good,good,good
"i have been using these strictly for litter box clean up and so far theyve held up quite well our 3yr old male cat drinks a lot of water and his pee blobs are huge these are holding up and have not ripped or even come close

i also really like that they are separate and you dont have to pull them apart i have had many different types rip tear etc due to this or are simply impossible to find where it is you separate them i really wanted a more eco friendly option but every one i read about did not seem like it would hold up well enough for my purposes so im sticking with these

my only complaint is that sometimes if my hands are even a little dry i have a hard time getting them open but if i dampen my fingers that does the trick i learned that from my buddy who was in facilities for many years",-,-,very good,very good,very good

but i have to say that i am highly allergic to scented products  this claims to be unscented but the scent to me is worse than the scented bounce that i typically use the product itself is great however if this is an issue for you just know that it has a scent you might want to check out before yiu buy such a large box  i have not used in the laundry yet  if i find it fades after a dryer cycle i will come back and edit my review,-,neutral,-,neutral,neutral
the sheets really make a difference in the amount of pet hair that comes out of the dryer i own 4 pets and youd never know it by my clothes,-,-,-,-,-
from what i can tell they work fair enough not a game stopper but okay ive bought these numerous times best ive found for elevating some hair,-,very good,very good,-,very good
great for parties or just any occasion that plastic cup is needed,-,-,-,-,-
good deal for party cups especially when needed lastminute they are literally just standard party cups i used to see at frat houses and now i occasionally buy them for group gatherings they hold a lot and sometimes the big size can make it hard to hold if you have smaller hands they are pretty light and not the strongest but they hold drinks just fine i prefer plastic over paper because they dont wear down in a day even if theyre holding drinks for hours,-,very good,very good,-,very good
i use the cups for every day cant handle glass  too heavy and dont care for plastic and not much for washing dishes wonderful for family and friends gatherings i always purchase quantity pack,-,very good,-,-,very good

"pros i used my zapper with and without bait definitely need bait for them mosquitos it draws in alot more mosquitos with the bait by at least 10 times the amount killed easy to clip on almost any bug zapper or to just lay into trap if you cant clip on it seems to be water proof and doesnt fall off with heavy rain falls or heavy wind speeds comes in a package easy to open and not get all over your fingers it doesnt smell or have bad oder

cons it is costly for just one package but still will buy more to replace on zapper",poor,poor,poor,poor,poor
i have not opened these yet but i am sure they will work just fine,-,very good,-,-,very good
could be better,-,-,-,-,-
i havent noticed an increase in zaps since installing these on my two traps  but then again i havent gotten any new mosquito bites  so overall id say its worthwhile purchase,-,-,-,-,-
bought this to make get the most use out of my bug zapper the packaging makes this seem bigger but as long as it lasts for 30 days that will be ok definitely have heard more strikes on the zapper since clipping it on and have seen way less mosquitos flying around me worth it if you have a bug zapper,-,very good,-,very good,very good
"last summer we purchased the black flag mosquito zappers for our mosquito infested yard placing one at each end they came with only one o octenol lure each but worked extremely well keeping the mosquitos off our deck so that we could enjoy our yard needless to say this year i have searched high and low and no one in our area carries them at all i am always offered a competitors lure that doesnt fit our units
very happy knowing i can order them here and have them readily available",-,very good,-,-,very good
i have quite a bit of flies on my property and i run a bug zapper 24/7 i have horses so i run it all the time to get rid of the biting bugs while the bug zapper will attract mosquitoes by itself when you add this its like a mosquito magnet it takes about two days for it to become fully effective so be patient when i clear out my bug zapper im clearing out probably about 2000 mosquitoes a night this is something i would make sure that i change every 30 days during the summer i am using a black flag 15 acre zapper,-,-,very good,-,very good
it worked fairly well however some of the pests still got me while sitting 6 feet from the zapper,-,good,-,-,good
product seems like good quality but it literally came with a shipping label stuck on the plastic bag and i had to rebag them all in a clean ziploc before putting them away minor annoyance,-,good,good,-,good

i love this product i have nerve damage to my back i have a strong tolerance to medication nothing has help me one night the pain was so bad inflammation so high till it felt like my back was on fire my son offered me a marijuana cigarette i refuse it at first but the pain got worse i then ask for the joint took two puffs and immediately i felt the muscles in my back starting to relax i couldnt believe it that night i had the best sleep i hadnt had in a long time talked to my doctor about what had happened and she recommended that i should continue with it i cant roll the papers so the raw cones are great i will be placing more orders in the future,-,very good,very good,-,very good
these king size cones are a great size because you can pack as much as you want in the cone if you are doing a solo sesh you can just fill it up half way or less if you want if you want to smoke with friends just fill the cone up a full cone is enough for at least 3 or 4 people these are very easy to pack especially if you cant roll joints very good the flavor is very smooth and tasty because there is no harsh taste like regular rolling papers these cones also burn nice and even and have a nice slow burn with no runs i think you get bigger lung fulls compared  to your standard rolled doobies too i have bought these at the local headshop and they are quite exspensive some reviewers have complained about price but i think they are priced right for the quantity and quality you get these are advertised to hold 15 grams which is a decent amount i will never roll another joint again lol anyone looking for an easy way to smoke your herb this is where its at,very good,very good,-,-,very good

"this little product is absolutely perfect for cleaning the louvers on the air conditioner filter door  no matter how much ive cleaned the dust off with microfiber cloths dust somehow manages to get caked on the louvers  i live in a humid climate which makes it easy for dust and dirt to get trapped in crevasses where traditional cleaning brushes cant reach

the brush isnt as powerful as i hoped it would be and i didnt know it is powered by 2aa batteries when i bought it  not a big deal  it comes with batteries preinstalled so it can be used right out of the box

im sure i will easily find other applications for this super easytouse power scrubber and will definitely enjoy using it  im happy to see on amazon there are replacement attachments available to purchase so i hope to get many years of use out of the product",-,very good,-,very good,very good
i love this thing its been my best friend during spring cleaning while still being great in daily cleaning and deep cleaning i hope they make a rechargeable version soon bc it does require 4 aa batteries,-,very good,-,-,very good
i received this product and i had to wait to use it before my review since it runs on batteries i didnt think it was going to be to powerful but to my amazement it really is now i used it on my stove top it did get it alot cleaner than it was i like that its small and easy to maneuver not heavy and very convenient to grab to scrub something real quick i would highly recommend it  i am not affiliated with this company by any means just a real review with my honest opinion,-,very good,-,-,very good
i was hesitant to buy this and put it offthat was a mistake  this thingy is great awesome and fantastic  i use it all around my stick faucets tile tops floor corners and the list goes on,-,very good,-,-,very good
more power than i thought  cleans great  easy to change out the batteries on the bottom love rubbermaid products,-,very good,-,-,very good
i was ready to return this product it had almost no power and while i was using it the batteries started hissing and blew the battery cover off i decided to put fresh batteries in to give it one more try and now it is super powerful even when i put pressure on it we will se how long the battery life lasts but i will likely be keeping it now change out the cheap batteries that come with the unit before you give up on it,good,good,-,good,good

im very glad i bought this window cleaning set  its made it much easier to reach my outside windows without needing a ladder so much safer too  it was easily connected and the cleaning pads are very nice my only comment is that i wish the rubber squeegee was a bit bigger giving it more flexibility to get a better grip on the window  that said this is a good value for the price,very good,very good,-,-,very good
"i was looking for something which would safely clean the windows windshield and back glass of the bus i researched several online and liked the description of this fantastic tool i read the instructions put it together and began cleaning the windows i was pleasingly surprised at how effective  simple and safe it was to clean all the windows except for the exit windows the 10” squeegee blade fit perfectly between the side windows panes scrub turn it over and squeegee horizontally and you are done the exit windows i turned the squeegee vertically
anything leaving a “streak” simply and effectively is cleaned by switching to the included microfiber pad
in areas where there are water restrictions like we are currently experiencing this system is perfect for effectively cleaning all the windows on the bus in less than 25 minutes easily effectively and safely while standing on solid ground my only suggestion is to advertise “great for cleaning school bus windows”  tomorrow i am cleaning the interior windows with the same technique only with just the one handle",-,very good,-,-,very good
pleased with this purchase easy to setup and use two sizes of squeegees work with different size windows and the extension gives plenty of length to reach high pots lightweight does a good job and cleans windows well,-,very good,-,-,very good
omg i cannot say enough about this product  we had 33 windows in a friends lake house to clean  within one hour we were finished and our hands/arms did not hurt  easy to use,-,very good,-,-,very good
the large squeegee doesnt get the edges of the glass because it extends a inch over the holder,-,-,-,-,-
gets the job done perfectly plus some easiest bang for your buck compared to all other products out here will probably buy a second just to stock up,-,-,-,-,-
as you make it longer its harder to get the pressure right and make a clean sweep but works fine when you consider the cost of a window washer have only used outside as may be messy indoors,poor,poor,poor,-,poor

im disabled and live on microwave or air fryer food i go through a lot of paper products and use these bowls almost every day they are great and can even hold up to being reused like if i just use one for fries or chicken tenders or hot dogs or something like that after cooking it in the microwave or air fryer then when it gets messy it goes in the recycling bag so i dont have to feel guilty about using so much paper product i have purchased these many times and will continue to use them oh and i also use them for messy things like soup beans and canned pasta and they have never leaked out the liquid from them,-,very good,very good,-,very good

"we did a subscription

and when you see it

it is a lot of boxes of tissue

but its 3/4months into our subscription
i chose every 6 months
and we used a lot
i was super surprized

i thought this subscription item might have been too much but i am glad i was mistaken whew

so one person in my household has mobility issues
going to costco or normal groceries is hard bc he doesnt move as fast and we are i am always very worried some kids/crazy suburban stay at home/aflluenza teen is going to run him over and be a jerk

so to prevent me from ever assailing people from running into/being jerks to him

i decided we should get the subscription

another selling point
say you are the only one taking care of someone special needs and you are a costcoer such as ourselves

costco is convenient

but lets say its just you
you have to assist your special needs person up into the vehicle safely
as well as the goods
bc they may not be able to assist you depending on their needs/limitations

also you have to unload by yourself while making sure you safely assist your special needs person from the vehicle into the house

my dad cant really lift boxes anymore
so helping with bulk items cant and should not and does not happen

my mom is retired and older as well
fully able but
with my schedule
i am not always with her to assist on errands
i either do errands for her
to/from work or on days off

instead of
lifting an awkward bulk order of tissues off a shelf onto/into a cart off the cart into the car then out of the car into the house then putting them up/storing them

orr

making so many runs to the store throughout the year for one or two boxes of facial tissue at a time

you can subscribe
and drag in an awkward parcel
once every 6 months
store it all and diminish supplies as you go
from the comfort of your own home
ps i do the heavy lifting in the house

our overall subscription order wasnt very heavy
especially since the tissue boxes took up most of the room

it comes in its own cardboard box
once you take it out to store visually you think hoooly d

we ordered in dec or jan
and we all have year round seasonal allergies
plus we keep a box on the dinner table
a box in our cars
one by our beds

i purchased this because 1 it doesnt cut down massive swaths of lovely trees like chmin does 2 the entire thing including packaging is plasticfree and im trying to cut down and 3 its a great deal while i love this for occasional use guest bathroom or finding it in an airbnb after 3 months of using it im afraid ill be switching and likely donating the remaining rolls this will be different for everyone but i guess my bum is rather pampered since i found the texture closer to paper which is fine for occasional use but starts to get too rough when used every single day it also tears and pills a lot when used with a bidet which i have  no intention of giving up because it is  a magical bum shower that makes you feel so insanely clean thats my two cents  if it ever gets just a touch softer and more durable id definitely want to switch back given its ecofriendliness and value until then ill likely just need to pay a bit more for softer ecofriendly tissue,very good,very good,-,very good,very good

i bought 2 boundary bug zapper light bulbs  ive used one outside in carport and one inside in different rooms  they both zapped a number of bugs to include small moths in the house it got a lot of the gnats the remains are too small to tell if any are mosquitos  the zapper is not as efficient as i would like  ive had one on across the room from me and still buzzed by a mosquito  ive used in bedroom with inconsistent results also but will say it has reduced the mosquitoes at times inside  the zapper outside in carport got some mosquitoes but i still was harassed by them while sitting there  the zapper outside was about 1015 feet away from me  i even had a citronella candle burning at my feet  maybe just too many hungry mosquitoes in that area  ill continue to use them for the amount it does work on  it does good on the gnats  being rechargeable is a benefit  they will run many hours with the zapper and low light setting,-,poor,poor,-,poor
i was impressed with this product,-,-,-,-,-
the media could not be loaded,-,-,-,-,-
i bought this little zapper light to bring with me when working in the garden  i have two acres of property and i do all the landscaping and irrigation myself  i am usually outside working from sunrise to sunset  we normally dont have many mosquitoes here in the sf bay area but we had an extremely wet winter and spring this year and the mosquitoes are out in full force  we use a dynatrap near our home which is great but out on the property there is nothing between me and the bugs  i bought this product because of its portability  i charged it for a few hours after it arrived and near dusk i brought it outside with me hanging it on trees near where i worked  i still got bit up because of the amount of mosquitoes but you can see this light did manage to kill a bunch after only an hour or so of use  i plan on using it every time i garden  it doesnt kill them all but just one mosquito can kill you  i plan on getting two more,-,bad,bad,-,bad
totally skeptical but so glad i bought i have plants and gnats and i thought this might work so happy w the purchase i have so few gnats now when i see one i yell it to go to the light,-,very good,-,-,very good
"however after a few months of use i noticed that the zapper light was no longer effective despite being fully charged the light was no longer attracting bugs and the zapper feature no longer worked i tried troubleshooting the product but nothing seemed to work and eventually i had to dispose of it

overall i would not recommend this particular bug zapper light to others while the initial performance was promising the product ultimately failed to deliver and did not provide value for its cost",bad,bad,bad,-,bad
works great easy to clean,-,very good,-,-,very good
took a trip to a hot humid destination where i thought mosquitos would be a problem it was the smartest thing i could do there were not many mosquitos but i could sleep at night rest assured they would be zapped and they were,-,-,-,-,-

great batteries,-,-,-,-,-
they are sturdy hard to see through the only down fall is you get i believe 28 and a lot other companies u get about 80 for the same price but when it comes to quality the quality over the cheaper brands is way better they have a strong lemon smell which is great for oders in batbrooms they are thicker and sturdier for sure so over all i would recommend them it fits the 5 gallon lowes buckets with extra room the others say 58 gallons are is very snuge as seen in the picture  the darker gray to the left is the  is glad brand and the more clear is a off brand glad fits much better both same size buckets and both brands said 58 gallon trash bins,very good,very good,-,-,very good
i got these for our bathroom waste baskets to help with odor it isnt always easy to find the 8 gallon bags and the draw tie is great the scent is very strong and permeated my whole house for days after opening them but they work very well the only things i would change would be more scent options and having the bags rolled with the ends overlapping instead of just perforated and still joined together because it takes two hand to separate them and then put the end back in the box i wish i could just reach into the cabinet and pull one out one handed like i do with my kitchen trash bags but that isnt a deal breaker unless i find other 8 gallon bags that are just as good but arent attached to one another,-,very good,-,very good,very good
i bought a smaller quantity at the grocery store because i was in a pinch amazon had a better deal and the bag really does trap odor the scent isnt too strong either maybe my own personal “negative” cause id wish it was even stronger holds a lot of things in the trash bag too,-,good,-,-,good

this product did a nice job on little nicks and scratches on my dark engineered wood floors a little more difficult to work with on a tabletop but probably a better solution than marking pens wax crayons etc  my problem with it is that it was shipped in box with other stuff and some of this oily pigmented product leaked from the bottle onto other stuff i ordered fortunately affecting only packaging it should have been tightly wrapped in plastic wrap the bottle top is one of those childproof pushdown and turn jobs that did not prevent maybe even caused the leak and very difficult for a person with arthritic hands to manage one bottle contains a lifetime supply of the product might be better sold in maybe a dozen foil packets with very small “doses” in each and i probably would still have a 3year supply in sum good product way too much of it awful packaging,-,neutral,neutral,neutral,neutral

"for the record i am reviewing 5 pack mop replacement heads compatible with spin mop microfiber spin mop refills easy cleaning mop head replacement

so a friend of mine moved recently and left a whole bunch of stuff at their last place some of it was good stuff that we inherited like this mop and bucket that uses the foot to spin the mop and wring out the water the only thing was the mop head was old and disgusting so i ordered some new ones they are really good quality not sure if they are made by the same company that makes the mop and bucket system but they fit perfectly into the triangle shaped mop and work great its funny since i had just bought one of the old style mops and it is still sitting in the garage with the plastic on it never even opened it probably never will either lol but hey this mop system works really nicely and the mop replacement heads are a really good deal i dont think i will have to buy any more any time soon but when i do i will look back here to find these and get them again i highly recommend them",-,very good,very good,-,very good

i ordered these on tuesday 5/9 and got them delivered on wednesday on thursday morning my senior dog had an accident that went unnoticed and the robot vacuum was kind enough to spread everything everywhere in my second floor i had to do a whole second floor cleaning and used these pods for the first time to mop up afterwards the citrus smell isnt strong which is great if you get migraines from smells i used about 4 of them one for each room the smell went away and my floors look great no streaks this is a great purchase because one pod is the perfect amount,-,very good,very good,-,very good
by far the best floor cleaner i have used i have hardwood floors it did not leave behind any streaks the dry time was quick  i love that the scent was not too strong i mopped my floor with pinesol prior to using a pac and i was surprised to see how dirty the mop water was after the pac  i will definitely be reordering,-,very good,very good,-,very good

these “pacs” are a nice crisp scent whether citrus fresh and energizing or lavender chill and relaxing could even use them as a morning / evening combo depending on when were mopping

they smell great and do improve the mopping performance as well which is obviously key  excited to buy these in bulk",-,very good,-,-,very good

"for two whole months now ive been dealing with a nonstop phorid fly often confused with fruit flies but have black eyes not red like fruit flies with curved bodies dont waste your money on vinegar traps like i did because they dont work on these with the black eyes infestation that seems to be coming from behind my apartments somewhere possibly a dead dog or cat or animal feces

i was at my wits end im sitting at my computer trying to game or just take care of work and i couldnt go more than 10 or 20 minutes without having another one of these tiny flies walking on my monitor and then flying in my face trying to get into my eyes mouth and nose as theyre attracted to moisture because thats what they like to breed in so imagine having to worry about bugs trying to go into any hole in your body to lay eggs in you on a daily basis this was extremely annoying and infuriating after several weeks of putting up with it

i tried rice vinegar which i had around the house both by itself and with dish soap or laundry detergent and that did nothing bought apple cider vinegar and not even one fly was caught after a whole day but i just found out these are actually phorid flies not fruit flies so thats probably why they seemed to really like my mango juice i had in a cup so i tried putting some of that in a cup with a little soap for them to drown in but that proved very ineffective as well strangely enough

then i finally had enough of it and forked out the 35 to get this baby here the liba bug zapper within a few minutes of me turning it on i heard a single very loud smack sound like when youre frying something on the stove with oil and youre getting those loud smacking sounds of the oil cooking or imagine someone slapping their hands together to make a really loud sound one time thats what the zaps sound like i went over to my new bug zapper and something had been cooked alright i saw one dead fly body lying on the collection tray i was ecstatic it really works all the great reviews i had been reading for several days were right no fake reviews here thats for sure and now i know that for sure after using this amazing bug zapper

ive had this zapper going for just one day now and my phorid fly problem is solved now thats not to say i dont have any flies coming into my house anymore they still come in regularly because really the only way to eradicate these things completely much like other pests is to eliminate the source their habitat where theyre laying the eggs and reproducing but in my case id just not rather go through all that trouble of going outside and investigating because i live in a pretty rough area and that wouldnt be a good idea snooping around in these parts glad im moving very soon

now the flies that do come around dont even bother with flying on my monitor or my tv screens like they used to they just go straight to this bug zapper and die when you see the product description saying the zapper is highly attractive to flying insects they mean it this is a literal statement they dont come after me or my computer monitor anymore they seem to love the lights in the liba bug zapper and prefer that now which is fine by me and one of the reasons why i love this product so much

its very easy to setup you just take it out of the bubble wrap make sure to read the very short manual that just tells you about the warranty and safety information then you just place it where you want it plug it in and let the insect cooking begin just make sure not to place it in any cramped areas put it somewhere it can just sit or hang by itself because this thing definitely packs a punch when things get zapped and you dont want your kids your pets yourself or anyone else getting shocked by it from touching the bars on it that have electricity running through them

i like how you have the two black rubber grips to hold onto if you need to move the product while its on or if you just turned it off and want to avoid touching the bars at all costs which i think you should do and it also has comes with two extra bulbs as well very generous of you liba the power cord for it is also a generous length as well which is great in case your power outlet isnt as close as you would like it to be if youre placing it on top of a counter or something and the outlet is near the ground like i am

one suggestion i would make to further improve the product is possibly some stands or just something anything to ensure there is no chance at all for the zapper to fall or topple over easily when its sitting on something and youre not hanging it i use a sleeping mat that i put on the ground and i have the outlet that goes to the zapper next to my feet and i have to be very very careful that i dont get my feet tangled in the wire and have the zapper fall over and shock me or other things and possibly cause a fire if worst comes to worst the zapper is pretty lightweight which is a good thing but it can easily fall over with not too much force being applied to the power cord which is a potential safety hazard or maybe some kind of mechanism within the product to make it automatically shut off as soon as it starts falling over or is in a bad angle and not standing straight up on its feet

but just be aware everyone the zaps are in fact very loud when these pests are killed so be prepared for that this is good because it ensures the insect will die and has no chance for survival but i will tell you right now if you live with other people they will hear it in other parts of the house had to explain what these loud popping sounds were coming from my bedroom haha but its worth it if i can have the peace of mind knowing its doing its job and a great job at that and i dont have to deal with these flies any longer this zapper takes care of them for me and dont worry about having other light sources in the room that may be competing with the zapper the zapper has everything covered liba did such a great job on this product the insects will go straight to the zapper and pretty much ignore the other light sources 99 of the time the uv lights on this are very very bright and attract them very well

all in all this is an excellent product it was worth every penny thank you liba for making such a great product for the world and bringing it to us here at amazon for all of us to enjoy youve relieved so much unnecessary stress from these bugs i had bothering me on a daily basis you have no idea now i am at peace once againi had my doubts about this product i was skeptical but not anymore i was wrong

also added a few pictures to show whats happened after only a day and this is just having it in my bedroom it wouldve caught tons more in the kitchen because it catches every single fly in the bedroom those pieces you see outside of the zapper are actually insect body parts im assuming due to some of their bodies exploding hahaha",very good,very good,very good,very good,very good
"tldr this bug zapper is the best purchase i have made all year

i cant tell if my house has a phorid or fruit fly infestation but they just exploded out of nowhere and its been a nightmare getting rid of them they have been having periods of little to no flies to a massive explosion of population for the longest time ive been using soapy vinegar traps fly paper and have even tried drain poison for sewer drain flies all have had minimal impact on their population sticky traps being the most effective of them  this bug zapper has been amazing while it hasnt eradicated them completely it has noticeably downsized their population i was worried the flies were too small to trigger the electric shock but just minutes after plugging it in they have been dying by the hundreds  i keep it on 24/7 in the kitchen and now we barely have any flies in the house

the only complaint i have is the loud electric pop it makes when a fly gets caught but its leagues better than having 20 flies buzzing around me while im working on the computer or eating lunch  its also satisfying in a way knowing that these damn flies are dying in droves after being a constant pest for the last year my house has bad windows that bugs can easily get into as a warning to those looking to buy the noise from each pop is loud enough to make your ears ring if you are in the same room as the zapper but the slight noise pollution is well worth the efficacy of this product

also be very careful the zapper retains some charge even after unplugging for a little while i had to move the bug zapper to other rooms to speed up the fly killing and while walking a fly flew into the zapper and it made a pop even with the switch off and the device completely unplugged

and it should go without saying but dont stick your fingers near the cage when moving i was readjusting the cage and my finger slipped inside without realizing and got zapped myself it hurts a lot and thankfully it was plugged into a safety outlet that had its own circuit breaker so i didnt get any electrical burns or serious injuries

cleaning the carcass tray is super easy it slides out safely from under the cage and you can either rinse it out or wipe it with a sanitary wipe into the garbage",-,very good,very good,-,very good
"good  it works and it works well

bad  if your dog doesnt like popping noises
like fireworks be aware that your dog will probably freak out i have 3 dogs 2 dont care about popping noises but the 3rd hides from them this bug zapper is very very loud when it zaps i jump almost every time my dog is more afraid of this than fireworks thunder gun shots combined ive never seen him so scared and he wont come back inside even a day later

ugly  the first time i turned it on i watched closely to see how it works it just so happened that it zapped a fly and the fly got wedged between the bulb and safety guard it didnt fall down to the tray the fly continued to zap and caught on fire the smell was awful too i turned it off and used a stick to dislodge the fly no cleaning tools are included once i did that it stopped burning and everything was fine this hasnt happened again ive had it 2 days now but i would not recommend hanging this up on your wall or leaving it unattended the fly was literally on fire and kept zapping while it was on fire which made the fire bigger even after turning the unit off it still zaps for several minutes

hope this helps i have a huge fly problem right now in my house so im going to keep using it until theyre all gone but once theyre gone this wont be used on a regular basis i cant sit here and watch it all day plus im worried my dog will have a heart attack",-,bad,bad,-,bad

"some picky users have noted these arent the most absorbant paper towels in the world lets set the record straight these guys dont even pretend to be super absorbant soft or squeesable when my wife opened them i asked her to toss me one to see if other reviews about lack of absorbancy were correct to my surprise it was like being tossed a dura log yup the wood origins of these paper towels are strong they are not processed into aerated 50 air 50 bleached flour these are wood if anyone doubts the wood origin of paper the proof is in these towels

you may be surprised to see a 5 star review well read on i am the father of several teenagers who dont think twice about ripping 3 to 5 sheets of paper towel to clean up condensate from the bottom of a cup yup no coasters for my kids not when 3 to 5 sheets of paper towels can clean up a self evaporating water film sometimes the water has evaporated before they return with the towels which of course are then used and get tossed into the trash

trying to explain to teenagers that paper towels cost money that use of a lot of towels for a small self repairing spill cant be cost effective is like trying to teach calculus to my dog no its worse the dog will listen and be happy to have the attention my kids get annoyed when dad lectures

today my 6 foot 14 year old son yanked on the georgia pacific preference 27770 white 2 ply paper towel roll it yanked back soft of due to the laws of physics this is the first roll of paper towels ive witnessed obeying newtons laws it has inertia each sheet has limited tensile strength thus a body at rest will stay at rest until acted on by an external force my son was able to rip only a single piece the mass of the roll fought back against his pull this as the pieces are thin and the georgia pacific rolls are massive he then proceeded to wipe the ice cream from his face the mass of the roll combined with the weakness of each individual sheet work with the law of inertia to limit the number of towels dispensed to a teenage boy making a mindless tug at the roll to clean up a small spot cost effective it was enough to make me want to teach physics to my dog but instead at my wifes urging the energy was diverted to writing this review the dog was in the shower getting cleaned and dried with a cloth towel that is another tale as the dog wasnt available my wife suggested i do something else with my time thus this review

now we return from the dog shower to the paper towel saga yes the georgia pacific paper towel was up to the challenge presented by my son his face was clean and he handt used 3 5 or 7 towels to complete the task instead he was able to yank but a single sheet yes bounty sparkle or whatever may be squeezably soft but this log barely disguised as paper towels is tough as wood and it makes me happy each roll is so massive that put on a stick they could be easily weaponized  put in a fire place id bet these georgia pacific preference 27700 paper towels would burn with some cajoling and give a dura log an unexpected challenge

so yes my wife and i still use softer two ply paper towels hidden in a place where our teenagers will never find under the sink we use the softer towels when needed but for the most part if you have a small spill a single sheet of these georgia pacific towels will clean it when the basement floods well chuck a few rolls bounty or a super sized roll of sparkle down to absorb the flood for most paper towel uses these georgia pacific wood shavings are great

if you need to dry a river get bounty or sparkle if you need to clean up a small spill get georgia pacific preference 27700 white 2 ply not the 1 ply not 27699 not the non preference ohhh no you need georgia pacific preference 27700 white for certain even in naming things georgia pacific seems to be a bit like wood im willing to bet 27700 has some meaning but come on bounty sparkle the competition at least pretends to make things seem inviting maybe advertising it as the weaponizable burning cudgel that also absorbs small spills would appeal to survivalists how about georgia pacific general purpose wood shavings",very good,very good,very good,-,very good

"i wasnt sure which of the three id like best i was intrigued by the flat triangle shape of the sellemer i liked the round compact look of the lefree and the boomjoy had a nice tweezer attachment which i can use to clean out hairs in my shower drain also boomjoy was the cheapest of all three

update the boomjoy metal handle has now gotten rusty and looks gross so i would not recommend this one

so you can see in my photo the type of packaging they come in the sellemer and lefree both also come with a little plastic piece that you can stick to your wall and hang the brush on your wall not really sure i care to do that though

i also placed all the brushes next to a coffee mug so you can see approximately what the sizes are i like the sellemer in that its svelte the lefree is also quite compact the boomjoy has the largest base so it would seem to take up most space but the size differences as you can see are minimal

the brushes in the lefree and sellemer hang to drain that is when you put the brush into the holder its suspended and theres a ventilated bottom the boomjoy is a solid bottom piece and the brush rests in it like a bowl i suppose that can cause some water accumulation and wont dry as easily/quickly

all three required the handles to be twisted on which were easy enough on all three i liked the handles on the sellemer and lefree over the boomjoy the boomjoy was the only one that had a metal part to the handle but for some reason it felt a bit flimsy the other two had all plastic handles

this is the first time i tried silicone brushes and overall i like the way the clean/work over the old bristle ones

sellemer i thought i would like the triangular shape as it said it could get under the lip easily but in trying all three of them out the flat triangular shape actually made it feel a little flimsier so i didnt feel i could brush as hard against the toilet i did like that there seemed to be good density on this one with the silicone bristles

lefree this one looked like it was most lacking in silicone bristles they were all spaced somewhat far apart but it still seemed to clean fine and i could press it up against the lip of the toilet and it got under there just fine just as fine as the sellemer i felt i could press pretty hard against the surface of the toilet too to scrub some of those harder water stains out

boomjoy this seemed to have more dense silicone bristles than the lefree but less than the sellemer it also worked much like the lefree i could get under the toilet lip easily and scrub pretty hard against the toilet surface

honestly they are all made in china products so the quality is all pretty much the same so what you are really deciding on are small features and which style you like the best

personally knowing what i know now i would buy the lefree while the bristles were the least dense it seemed to clean just as well as the others it has a small footprint with a ventilated bottom i just didnt really care for the flimsy feel of the flat triangle sellemer and the boomjoys nonventilated bottom bothered me a bit in that i think if water were to gather and drip when i pick it up next time it would be gross i do like having the tweezer but is it really necessary? it also has the largest base i do like its very sleek look though and the fact that it doesnt put its brand across the base

also if price is of concern the sellemer was most expensive at around 1517 depending on when you buy it i see a lot of price fluctuations the lefree is around 13 and the boomjoy was 999

overall all three worked pretty well and i think i will stick to silicone over the bristles from now on",very good,very good,very good,very good,very good
i use this in my guest/first floor powder room it looks nice  i like that the bristles are thin so it is easy to keep clean  i will probably buy another when i need it for my upstairs bathroom i definitely recommend it,-,very good,-,-,very good
i bought this for my camper toilet having a plastic rv toilet i didnt want to scratch the bowl using a standard toilet brush this silicone brush does the job,-,-,-,-,-
the bristles make cleaning a lot easier but i do find that hard water stains are tougher to get out great product,-,-,-,-,-
i bought this to use in my 5th wheel in which i live fulltime  the toilet mfg says not to use a regular brush because it will ruin the seals  ive already had that problem  for various reasons i purchased a new toilet and decided to give this brush a try  so far so good  it does take a little getting used to scrubbing with the silicone vs bristles and takes a bit of elbow grease  the brush seems sturdy enough to handle it  i do like im able to shake off the water and therefore dont have hardly if any standing water in the toilet holder,-,neutral,neutral,-,neutral
gotta go with the bristles  i tried the rubber ones  nope  but it keeps coming unscrewed  thats cuz i use a twisty motion when goin to town on da toidy  so i guess i just gotta twist to the right like i did last summer,-,good,-,-,good
like the silicone brush  shape works well so far,-,good,-,-,good

took a lot of scrubbing with abrasive sponge and steel wool pad didnt completely clean tough spots but worked well enough,-,good,-,-,good
tldr it really works on really tough really old spots i tried all kinds of harsh chemicals and abrasives on my new shower doors with no luck best i found was scraping with a razor blade and regular scrubbing with steel wool but still left a lot of spots i thought they were going to be permanent one expert website recommended wet sanding with 30007000 grit sandpaper which i luckily tried on a small area first because it scratched the glass but did not remove the spots so i had my doubts when reviewers claimed this product removed old soap scum and tough water stains well i was blown away by the results not only was my glass crystal clear but it was effortless it only took a peasized drop on a wet sponge per side of glass there was no harsh fumes or scrubbing my tip is use lots of water the directions recommend a damp cloth but it felt gritty and did not go on evenly so i kept adding water until it was dripping wet also use lots of water when rinsing off and run a clean sponge or your hands over the glass or it may leave a hazy film behind,-,very good,-,-,very good
"i saw this on one of those articles with a teaser headline like top 25 products users love at amazon  when i think of rainx i think of that stuff you used on your windshield in the 90s to bead up the water i was hoping for the same thing for the shower door to keep it clean i was disappointed

i tried it two weeks in a row the first time i just figured i didnt follow directions the second time i followed directions exactly  both times it didnt get all the grime off and left a haze in some areas i ended up recleaning it using what i will continue to use for soap scumscrubbing bubbles it does a better job with less effort",-,very good,very good,-,very good

"these have become my goto brand of facial tissues  unfortunately they are out of stock quite often so when theyre available i load up  they are a great value buying by the case and the quality is as good or better than most other tissue boxes ive bought recently  i like these because they are the pull out kind where only one tissue is dispensed at a time  to me thats better than the stacked/layered tissue boxes where sometimes the kids grab a dozen at a time

so i reviewed a different brand of dryer balls because i bought two different brands just to see if there was a difference this one is 100 australian wool as was the other brand i found that both brands performed the exact same way both had certification labels stating 100 australian wool and the balls were about the exact same size so i washed 4 towels and dried them with 3 balls the towels came out fluffy dry and with a nice scent as i put some essential oil onto the one of the balls having never used these type of balls until the purchase of this set and the other i had never heard of them before i will be using them all the time now no need for dryer sheets and the softener build up they leave behind i was quite impressed with these dryer balls i would recommend them over dryer sheets from now one they say the balls last over 1000 dries well that is a lot less than buying dryer sheets no static no wrinkles to speak of and easy to use just throw a few balls in the dryer with your towels sheets pillow cases and your are off and running i could see them working through the window in my dryer pretty impressive for about 10,-,very good,very good,-,very good
dryer balls has always been one of those products i wanted to try but never did i recently purchased a new dryer and thought what the heck i am going to try the dryer balls i use these with all my clothes except jeans and towels maybe i could use them on those items too but i didnt want any dye to transfer not sure if that is even a problem as i am new to these anyway i am nothing short of amazed with how my laundry comes out of the dryer no static and no wrinkles providing you dont over dry lol my husband does miss a little scent in his shirts but i like how the clothes have more of a fresh smell,-,bad,-,-,bad
"these dryer balls are perfect i add a few drops of essential oil to each and my towels smell like theyre freshly laundered in a nice hotel plus the towels are super soft

as they are wool they have shrunk a bit due to laundering between scent profiles however theyre still at least the size of tennis balls and do a great job

"i recently purchased the budieggs wool dryer balls and i am thrilled with their performance this set of six extralarge dryer balls made from 100 organic new zealand wool is an excellent alternative to traditional fabric softeners and dryer sheets

one of the things i love about these dryer balls is that they are chemicalfree making them safe for use with baby clothes and hypoallergenic for those with sensitive skin they are also ecofriendly and can be reused for over 1000 loads which is fantastic value for money

the budieggs wool dryer balls are incredibly effective at reducing wrinkles and static in clothes as well as shortening the drying time naturally they work by separating the clothes in the dryer allowing air to circulate more efficiently which reduces drying time and energy consumption

another benefit of these wool dryer balls is that they help to fluff up clothes which makes them feel softer and more comfortable to wear they are also very durable and i have not noticed any shedding or pilling even after multiple uses

overall i am very impressed with the budieggs wool dryer balls and i would highly recommend them to anyone looking for a more ecofriendly and natural way to soften clothes reduce wrinkles and shorten drying time they are well made effective and an excellent investment for anyone looking to reduce their environmental impact and save money on laundry costs",very good,very good,very good,-,very good
ive used them only 3 times so far seems to help get clothes dried a bit faster i did notice one of the loads had lots of static when i took them out so i guess it will be something that ill have to try a few different things to see what works best i did add essential oil to a few of them and it added a bit of smell to the clothes again that might be something that i have to adjust as i use them if i no longer have to purchase fabric softener and dryer sheets this will be a great deal it states good for 1000 loads  thats at least 5 6 years for me yay  i will come back and update after a few months of use,-,very good,very good,-,very good

"overall i like that i can do automatic cleaning without ruining the flapper in my toilets however a couple of my toilets have very snugfitting tank lids and i could not fit these since theyre so cheap i modified them by breaking off the clip and using 3m extreme doublesided tape instead the one toilet that wasnt so tight was quick and easy with the clip this does ding it a bit for easy to use

scent is straight up bleach which is mostly only noticeable when you flush

my only real complaint has to be that one was shipped without a seal which makes it leak in the tank i made my own seal with cardstock and silicone plumbers grease but i shouldnt have to do that",good,good,-,-,good
"every once in a while i stumble on a product that makes me irrationally happy  and this right here is one of them  where has this thing been all my life?  why didnt this company directly reach out to me when they invested this to let me know about it?  i guess ill never know but i suppose i can forgive them

when using those bleach pucks they sit in the tank and over time they can deteriorate the seals inside of your toilet tank  well this little device installs easily and instead drains directly down the tube that refills the toilet after you flush instead of letting your rubber seals soak in bleach  problem solved and such a simple solution  i cant speak to the longterm cleaning yet but so far so good  this is a gem",-,very good,very good,-,very good
i had this long time ago in our upstairs bathroom but removed it for some reason the clorox tablets ate away rubber parts in tank the blueing tablets never dissolve with out help and bottle same the inside bowl wall stickup ware out fast and price has jumped on all so ill try this again after installing found the water level is much better in the bowl and flushing better if thats possible needed to change flapper chain position but all working out,very good,very good,very good,very good,very good
"when my wife said she wanted a scrubfree continuous cleaner installed in the toilet tank i told her i had been there and done that  i refused to put tablets in the tank  she insisted so i searched for a solution  first i tried one that hangs on the rim  the scent was pleasant but it still required regular cleaning under the rim and above the water line  it was okay but not ideal  i eventually decided it wasnt worth it  i decided to give the kaboom system a try  it works very well  i highly recommend it

some say it has a clean light scent  it is more of a bleach scent  i normally sit about 8 feet from the toilet  it was overpowering enough to make me sneeze  after a month or so ive gotten used to it and it doesnt bother me anymore  i dont even notice it  im a little concerned about having these fumes around all the time

it does cause the tank top to shift forward and hike up in the back  at first i thought it was going to be a problem  its okay

ive installed it on three toilets  all three are a little different  all installed quickly without a problem  its cheap simple and effective  it seems to be the ideal delivery system  i suppose it could be used for other things besides bleach",very good,very good,very good,-,very good
"depending on your toilet it may or may not fit research your toilet before you buy the product actually take the tank top off and look at it you may be surprised have ran this for 3 flushes and its good no lingering smell other than bleach smell you would normally get from a fresh clorox or a lysol tab dropped into the tank this however wont mess with the seals in tank causing it to leak and run because of the bleach tabs dropped into the tank directly its not in the tank it pours directly into to toilet bowl when it fills big bonus
you will need to flush a couple of times to prime the unit with water then the toilet bowl will fill up to the level you are used to if it leaks you have done something incorrectly check your installation
dont discount it because you dont know or understand how a toilet works in a flush cycle really no one wants to understand that but in this case it works and works well
longevity time will tell see what i did there ha ha of course the bleach pucks will need to be replaced seek them out as you would and as long as they can fitgood good",-,very good,very good,-,very good
"i have been using these in all my toilets for 15 years  they keep the bowel clean of algaes and organic rings  better than dropping tabs directly into the tank as the chems can deteriorate the plumbing components over time this little gadget puts the chemical into the bowle only  i have soft water so mineral build up is not an issue and i dont know how these will address that

i have one on each toilet and stayed using bromine tablets i use for a hot tub for one and the bleach tablets for the other both stink but bromine isnt as strong  unfortunately idk which actually works better though

havent used long enough to see if these will degrade the rubber/silicone/wax/plastic parts but that could be a concern with long term use

for a tablet cleaner its not bad one benefit is that  the toilet doesnt smell like chlorine as other tablets do however depending on the residual of the water the tablets might go faster than three months mine didnt last a month however cleaning the toilet bowl was easy and i didnt have to clean it as much so there is that benefit,-,-,-,-,-

"i debated for months on purchasing the ocedar easywring rinseclean mop system  im glad i did  the user guide is easy to understand and follow as its written in steps with pictures the mop handle is easy to put together as is the mop head by positioning it correctly and simply pressing down with your foot  the clean rinse bucket is removed from the main bucket which makes it easier to fill water from the faucet and to add your favorite floor cleaner  it just sits on top of the main bucket  lift the red lever and the clean water flows into the clean water chamber  the clean and dirty water are separate  i just love the way it spins the mop head you control the dampness of your mop the only drawback is placing the mop head into the wringer especially if you want to get all the microfibers spun  sometimes i had to adjust the mop head manually and/or the fibers to get all the fibers into the wringer  when spinning be sure to hold the mop handle loosely
the mop handle does not seem flimsy as some reviews stated  when mopping the floors i push the bucket along the floor but the handle is sturdy and system is not too heavy to carry  the handle has a groove which will hold the mop upright  after finish mopping there is a convenient spout on the bucket to pour out the dirty water  my floors had some packedin dirt which the mop did not clean even though i kept mopping back and forth several times  but for the most part it did a good job  overall i really like the mop system",-,very good,very good,-,very good
"this cleaning system came highly recommended by several friends so i broke down and bought one and can confirm that it is a must have  i use this mop almost daily right now we live in missouri which in the spring means lots of muddy kid  paw prints get tracked in our entryways i love the separation of the clean  dirty water  ill admit the spin pedal is pretty fun for me this mop makes cleaning a lot less dreadful its actually enjoyable and quite satisfying watching dirty floors become sparkling clean

i do wish the reservoir bucket had wheels or an at least an optional attachment bottom piece with wheels that the bucket could be set on still think its worth every penny without wheels but a woman can dream ",-,very good,-,-,very good
i like that the clean and dirty water are separated also the spin side wrings out as much or as little water as youd like depends on how much you spin it it worked so much better than my old string mop where  i was just using the same water the true test was when id finished my old method if i took a wet paper towel to the floor it still showed dirt with this new mop it was as clean as could be even though this is my least favorite house cleaning chore this mop made it so easy and was glad to finally have a clean floor,-,very good,-,-,very good
"the ocedar easywring rinseclean microfiber spin mop  bucket floor cleaning system complete with 2 extra refills has exceeded my expectations in terms of deep cleaning ease of use and maneuverability this mop and bucket set has become an essential tool for maintaining clean and spotless floors in my home

the overall concept behind this product is brilliant it does what you want it to do keeping your clean and dirty water separate is a great idea when it comes to a mopping concept the only negative that i can say is that the mop head is too small for my liking there was an earlier version of this mop that had a bigger head and that would probably be better because you clean a larger surface area with less effort however that version didnt have the clean/dirty water separation so neither version is perfect if they merged the best features of their earlier design with this one theyd have a home run,-,-,-,very good,very good
i loved it and worked wonderfully but i no longer have it since i had to leave a lot of things behind during my move but i left it with someone who is still using it after 2 yrs of use and no problems the only thing i dont like is you cant put bleach inside with the water which makes no sense to me and their is no proper way to thoroughly clean the inside of it where you pour the water in but nothing some hot water natural cleaning products and air dying cant fix i guess,-,bad,-,-,bad
just used it for the first time and i do like it love that it keeps the dirty water separated however similar to other reviews i received a red three piece rod that does not adjust ive reached out to the sender to try to receive the correct handle the red one is pretty short and im short already at 52”,-,very good,very good,-,very good
"this stuff is great it is thin and the paper would not be soft except it is so thin its also strong but falls apart quickly in water so it wont plug plumbing feeling the texture when i first bought it i wondered but my wife and i both love it now for several reasons 1 if you tear off a longer strip than usual for ordinary two ply it is actually much more effectivea wad of it contours much better and its strong enough to wipe well and does not leave fragments on you 2 no perfume 3 no risk of clogs or septic problems if youre on septicwere on sewer 4 a real biggie does not leave lint all over everything in the bathroom safer youre not breathing lint and far less messy than the fluffy stuff 5 a roll lasts much longer than the two ply stuffespecially the fluffy two ply stuff

listen if you like feather soft fluffy toilet paper this isnt for you but its also not your public bathroom toilet paper for the price of how much you get out of just 1 roll and how well it works nobody can beat it so its worth it all day and then some,very good,very good,-,-,very good
"thin lightweight single ply  if you dont want your toilet clogged use this  it is not soft and fluffy and does not create a small pile of lint on the floor underneath the tp holder  i dont know why people complain about this paper?  i grab enough of it until i have a wad in my hand that feels like it will be enough  i recently filled my toilet with this paper so i could test out a new plunger  i could not clog the toilet and i used tons of it and was really trying to create a clog  i was not able to test the plunger  the entire bowl looked like i used almost an entire roll  if you do that with fluffy papers you will absolutely have a clog  being this is single ply the paper starts to disintegrate as soon as it hits the water so no clog

 this should be sold by weight so people could make a fair comparison to any other paper they are using or considering  all tps have different sized sheets and plys  the only thing left is the weight of the roll to make a comparison at least for price  in my small household of 2 one roll will last 12 weeks  each full roll weighs anywhere from 57  6 ozs  after weighing about 10 rolls most are 59

some people will receive an embossed paper with an imprinted pattern and others are flat white paper  i called the mfr about this and i was told they are both genuine scott products  depending on which factory made them some will be embossed and others flat  if you are purchasing from amazon as the seller and not a 3rd party this is genuine and not fake  i am so tired of reviews claiming products are fake",good,good,-,-,good

original review bought a pack of 8 seemed fine but after about 18 months of intermittent use 4 batteries no longer hold a charge the ones that are still working seem to be ok hold a charge and last a good while but with only 4 usable the value suffers may try another pack to see if more regular use makes a difference",very good,very good,-,-,very good

they are easy to clean too i know that some folks just stick them in the dishwasher i have learned over the years that tossing them into the washing machine on a hot cycle with bleach to kill bacteria and white vinegar in the rinse cycle to prevent any musty smell not only works better to keep these clean but doesnt cause them to fall apart as you can see from the pictures this method works to keep them clean
i also use these sponges in the bigger size in the bathroom they have always kept my bathtubs and shower walls clean of soap scum without much effort needed to put into scrubbing i have a separate sponge for the floors since mopping around the toilet and cabinets with an actual mop doesnt feel clean or sanitary

"i started noticing a bunch of gnats flying around in a couple rooms at one end of the house i dont know how the gnat community works and whether they have queens or just mates or whatever but it was such a large number of gnats that suddenly appeared within a week or so i imagine it mustve been a female gnat that snuk in an open door and then layed a bunch of eggs somewhere in one of those rooms
  but during the day i would see them zooming around and drove me crazy because theyre just fast enough to either evade a swift clap and small enough to escape your ability to track their erratic flight through the air anyway i noticed that every night they were attracted to the large mirror in the connected bathroom they would land there and just sit there all night i didnt want to spray bug spray all over the place around my bathroom sink and unfortunately since the mirror is obviously glass you cant simply smash them with your hand for fear of breaking the mirror plus if i was able to kill one with my thumb or a hand towel the rest would fly away and wouldnt land back on the mirror again for a while
  so that is what lead up to my purchase of this bug zapper the day this product was delivered i cleared off my bathroom counter plugged it in and turned it on around bedtime as usual the gnats were all over the big mirror so i swatted at the mirror to scare them off the mirror to get them flying around i then turned the bathroom light off left the bathroom and closed the door behind me
  on top of the sleek design of this bug zapper it is powerful within minutes i started hearing it go to work vaporizing the pests into oblivion as they flew into the uv light the voltage arc is basically as loud as those little gunpowder poppers we used to throw when we were kids so its not something you want to have in the same room if your trying to rest or sleep by the next morning there were countless dead gnats in and around the zapper many times charred exploded bits problem solved
  i can think of so many times in the past when there was one or two pesky flies or mosquitoes in the house and i was lucky if i was able to keep track of them long enough and be quick enough to swat them in time before they zipped out of sight this is the solution for all those times you find yourself being pestered by something so small that becomes the source of so much frustration",-,bad,bad,bad,bad
this little lamp has saved my legs and my kids faces i live in a hot and humid climate and by spring/summer mosquitoes become such a problem specially for me i get a allergic reaction every time i get bitten my skin gets extremely red and swollen and the bite site becomes painful to the point i have to take pain medicine after that i am left with dark scars that will remain on my skin for a long time enter this lamp the first couple of nights i didnt see many cadavers but i think it was because i was using it at the wrong time after the first couple of nights of leaving it on i was amazed by the results the best part is that i havent seen any mosquito inside my house nor i or my kids have new bites from them i dont have to scream at people entering my house and we can all relax a little every time we go in/out,-,very good,very good,-,very good
"i like that it runs on usba  i have plenty of those chargers laying around so i can always find one if i lose the one its using  doesnt come with one no big deal

the light is powerful  i literally swamps the cheap asian one i got at the local market in the philippines  that bulb was about 2 watts but not sure that was an honest rating  this one is said to be 5 watts but the difference in brightness is huge  i feel like bugs will see this and be attracted to it as soon as they come in the room whether my laptop screens are still on or not  in fact i run it on the low setting figuring maybe the bulb will last longer if i dont run it wide open constantly  with the cheap asian one every other light source in the room had to be off for it to grab the attention of the mosquitos in the room

bonus  the power cable included is actually a data cable for anyone who might like that  its a pretty soft and pliable feeling higher quality than i expected",very good,very good,-,-,very good
love this product living in florida during the rainy season every time we open the door to let the dogs out or just every day  an annoying fly or gnat or moth will fly through the door over time well have several flying around and being annoying not any more with this electric bug zapper for indoor outdoor use i just plugged it into my usb wall socket and turn it on for a couple of hours a day and no more pest i love it was just what i was looking for,-,good,good,-,good
"the first one i got fell from a curtain rod when the hook broke and wouldnt work after that it was a week past the return window the company immediately sent out a new one so we were only a couple days without a zapper
so far its worked well killing house flies soldier flies and fungus gnats the zap isnt any louder than others they all make a loud noise when the bugs fly in it seems to be working well so far if this lasts for six months ill buy a few more for other rooms in our home
the only thing i dont like is the lack of a catch tray for the bugs the only way to clean it is to use a brush to get the bugs out and to rinse it clean i dont care for the idea of using water to clean it but will try it out soon down side is leaving it to dry the brush works fine its just not as simple as others that have a tray and removable grate that can be reached easier

"not too many years ago angel soft toilet paper had and for many years been one of the softest ones on the market at some point it degraded into a very scratchy and inferior product and i ceased buying it after a few recent purchases i decided that although it had shrunk in terms of square footage the newer product is now softer it is promoted as being septic tank safe the current paper is a little thicker than it had been when at its scratchiest though and as i find the current softness reasonable for the price i will continue to buy this tissue contingent upon it not degrading again in quality there is a discount store in my area which sells softer toilet paper of similar quality and i will also continue to purchase that paper when in the area of the big lots store please note that with many toilet papers now there will be a good bit of dust around the tpholder as toilet paper rolls continue to shrink in width there is much excess space on the holder therefore the dust is readily visible  i rate this toilet paper quality with 35 of 5 possible stars with my score rounded up to 4 starrating

the number of mega rolls and number of sheets on each roll wont tell you much about the actual product cost because among brands mega rolls and their individual tissue squares can vary in size  to determine the actual cost of toilet tissue divide the number of square feet per roll into the total cost per roll example  649 for 8 mega rolls is 81 cents per roll 8 rolls into 2702 total square feet per package is approximately 3376 square feet per roll 81 divided by 3376 square feet totals approximately 024 for each square foot  or just divide cost of package by total square footage for easy cost per square foot and compare brands this way either method provides actual cost for brand comparisons",very good,very good,very good,very good,very good

dont usually give reviews but this one certainly deserves a great one  if you struggle with hard water build up in your toilet bowl and have given up like i did this is the product for you  harsh chemicals are not something i prefer to use and they dont work anyway  you will need some elbow grease but with persistence and pressure the hard water stains do come off and in my opinion rather quickly  i had to use both sticks and 45 minutes later the bowl was clean  nothing harsh in your bowl to spray and leave for an hour or so  then try to come back later and scrub  i immediately ordered two more to have on hand,-,very good,-,-,very good
my boys bathroom toilet was atrocious i tried everything and these finally did the trick no more scale or scum in the toilet bowl it might have scratched the surface a bit but i cant tell regardless its still 100 times better than it was i would recommend draining the toilet first as the first stick i used fell apart from the water the 2nd attempt worked great once i drained the bowl google on how to drain as its very easy its so nice to have a sparkling white clean toilet again,-,very good,very good,-,very good
after moving into a new place we tried so many different ways to get the hard stains out of the master bathroom toilet a bunch of different scrub brushes clr soft scrub steel wool you name it a coworker suggested these to me and let me tell you it took some muscle and elbow grease but i am so happy with the results nothing else even came close to this once i rest my arm a little bit i plan on trying to get the very bottom of it haha would definitely purchase again,-,very good,-,-,very good
i was looking for something that would actually get tough buildup out of the toilet ive used a lot of stuff but so far nothing that would work on what i was dealing with without using anything else alongside this it scrubbed off everything i needed it to between both of the set my only complaint is once it gets smaller so if youre using this on the toilet start in the deeper parts first and then work up as it whittles down highly recommend this,-,neutral,-,-,neutral
i just received these sticks today and used them on a toilet that had some serious brown stains all around it after trying other ways to get the stains off to no avail after reading reviews i figured i would give these a try i have to say these sticks are pure magic after some serious scrubbing i managed to get all the brown gunk off except for a few spots but because i used the sticks to nubs i just ordered another 2 pack as now i will not live without pure pure magic in a stick,-,poor,-,-,poor

i bought this out of desperation with no actual hope that it would be worth it it does i vacuumed my couch the day before this arrived and it looked better but not clean and i spent time and elbow grease on it this arrives today and i try it out and it pulled more cat hair than i ever would have thought possible im going to order a longhandled one for the carpets holy heck its so good,-,very good,very good,-,very good
"this was recommended to me on a house cleaning site when i asked about getting stair carpeting vacuumed i was skeptical about the tool because i wanted a vacuum head but omg its wonderful

you rake away and it removes mass quantities of dog hair going back to a previous dog who died a few years ago and whose hair was the same color as the carpet i was seeing the black hair of the current dog but no vacuum had sucked up any of the dog hair properly

using this tool requires a bit of effort but its so fun it doesnt matter and the wads of dog hair harvested and the look of the rug are thrilling to see i leave my rake on the stairs so i can use it whenever the mood hits me on the way up or down i havent started on the other areas where theres carpet because crawling around on my knees just isnt that appealing but the stairs are a limited area so im on it",-,good,-,good,good

the pet hair remover ive used is incredibly easy to use  just run it over any carpeted surface that has pet hair on it and the hair sticks to the device like magic its amazing how quickly and effectively it removes pet hair without leaving any residue behind

one of the best things about this pet hair remover is how versatile it is ive used it on various types of carpets and it works great on all of them plus its gentle enough that it wont damage any of the surfaces you use it on

another thing i love about this pet hair remover is how easy it is to clean when the device gets full of pet hair you just need to rinse it off with water and its ready to use again its so convenient not having to constantly buy replacement parts or refill it with sticky sheets

overall i would highly recommend this pet hair remover to anyone who has a pet that sheds its effective easy to use and versatile making it a musthave tool for any pet owner with carpeted floors",-,very good,-,-,very good

if any variety of mammals live in your carpeted home buy this tool you wont regret it

i like the bona cleaner because it fits well on the cleaning pad unlike the one i got from my floor installer that had elbows that stuck out and banged up my new floorboards  it gets my lvp floors clean but the spray angle is kind of wide so i have to point it away from my furniture when i spray  since it is oversized it is hard to clean bathrooms and areas where there isnt much room between pieces of furniture  i also mop back and forth so i find it almost as tiring as vacuuming  my husband zips around in hyperdrive and says there isnt a problem  i may have to follow suit even though that is not my nature  you need to buy more mop pads though because you may want to change during the course of your cleaning and also you want a dry one to set your mop on when you are done,-,-,-,-,-
i liked the performance of bona products in my robot mop so well that i purchased this bona manual mop system for mopping areas in my home where the robot mop cant fit  the kit arrives wellpackaged with clear instructions for assembling the mop handle and attaching the refillable tank  the mop pad attaches securely to the mop base  the handle is comfortable to hold and the trigger spray works easily and puts out a wide spray path  the cleaning solution performs well cleaning up the dirt and leaving no streaks  the mop pad is machine washable and dryable  i have only hung up mine to dry since i am also washing and drying robot mop pads at the same time and the latter cannot go in the dryer  i am thoroughly pleased with this mop system,-,very good,very good,very good,very good
id hoped that the bona would work well but i did not expect it to work superbly which it does  our hardwood flooring is quite dark and shows any dull areas or where there may have been a liquid spill in the kitchen that didnt clean up all that well  i bought the bona a month ago and am really amazed at how easy it is to use and how well it works  this product clearly has earned its longevity and fine reputation,-,very good,-,-,very good

ive gone through so many products and wasted so much money on things that did nothing but spread the dirt around on our vinyl floors and make them look worse than before i cant even describe how happy i am to have found bona it blows every other product out the water and it makes my floors look amazing  even better than after steam mopping it there is little to no odor which i  my doggies appreciate greatly and there is never any residue left over after using it as with other products ive tried that left the floors feeling sticky and/or really slippery,very good,-,-,-,very good

the bulb installs easily but the range is limited  if i venture more than 20 feet away i start to feel the mosquitos again,-,-,-,-,-
"its a good bulb easy enough to install if you have decent screwdriver skills  watch out for the small clip and its associated small screw that holds the clip in place which holds the bulb in place  if you can hold the screw on the end of the screwdriver with your index finger while you insert it into the unit body you can replace that screw fairly easily

but these bulbs dont last long  they only last on average around four months according to dynatrap or around 3000 hours of use  id prefer a better value for the money  or a discount on a threepack to last me the whole year

this lamp has to be used with a dynatrap mosquito trap  it is not a mosquito repellent as denoted in the amazon product description  it attracts mosquitoes and kills them in the trap  this is the reason you should set it up 2030 feet from the area you want to protect so that it draws mosquitos away from your living areas  effectiveness is hard to really quantify due to a couple of factors  it does collect a lot of mosquitoes as well as many other insects such as moths flying ants small wasps etc  so when you empty the trap you may have difficulty seeing a the mosquitoes due to the fact that they are much smaller than the other insects trapped  if you kind of sift through the remains you can see the mosquitoes as well  the amount that are killed relative to the population in the area is unknown  making a comparison based on how often you are bitten is hard because it depends upon the amount of time you spend outside and other things that affect the mosquito population such as rainfall standing water presence of predators that feed on them etc  our general observation is that you can and will be bitten if you stay outside for very long at dusk or after dark but that the frequency of bites is less  hope this helps  we think that we have enough evidence of effectiveness to keep buying the bulbs and using the trap,-,poor,poor,-,poor

i like how easy it is to put the brushes on and off when it comes to cleaning i do not have to scrub hard because this product does it for me and it does the job well done it deep cleans  literally saved me hours of cleaning i finish in 15 minutes the maintenance is very lowkey too but ofcourse you still have to take care of it no matter what just so the product will last long i also like the long life of battery the handles and brushes are easy to assemble i recommend it,-,very good,-,-,very good
a co worker recommended i get this and i was skeptical but did  when it arrived it was packaged in a small narrow box when i opened it i was surprised to see all the attachments that are included and the extension handle  i charged it and cleaned my bath tub first we have hard water so it is always a challange to scrub it  usually im sitting on my knees but with the extension i was able to stand which was nice  i used a brush and the scrubber pad  it worked great  the only thing is i would be able to put more pressure without the handle on  my only other concern is how to get replacement scrubber when this one wears out great purchase good battery life and easy to recharge  many different uses and attachments you could polish your car  im very happy,-,very good,-,very good,very good
i bought this product after returning another similar item because the height of the handle was still putting pressure on my back im happy to say that this product is much better in regards to the height and stability of the extending pole it doesnt wobble around while you use it and all you have to do is extend your arm no pressure needed im so glad i switch to this one as well because it has more attachments so i can use on every surface in my house which i have my only gripe is the quality of some of the attachments the brush heads looks wired out the box and hard to change out the heads when needed however it does come with a warranty so i may use that to hopefully get some repairs/replacements,-,very good,-,very good,very good
ive seen these kind of cleaning spin brushes all over tiktok and knew i just had to get one i searched amazon for a couple of days there are so many and i had a hard time choosing one i ultimately ended up choosing this one because it had a 15 hour usage time after a full charge a lot of others only an hour so i got this one and it came super fast same day i charged this baby up and was so excited to scrub the grout between the tiles on my kitchen floor i was at first like yeaahhh this is the business i dont even have a very large kitchen its just i guess a normal sized kitchen i got about halfway through and it died that gave me a not even 40 minute run time are you kidding me? almost 60 for not even an hour run time and it takes like 3/4 hours to fully charge i think im past my window to return because i was like well maybe i didnt charge it all the way maybe i thought it was charged all the way used it again same thing happened and when you are a mom of 5 running a business and all the normal stuff you sometimes put things like this on the back burner and then when you circle around its like oh shoot i mean honestly the concept is great it definitely works its well made it comes with several different attachments its still a good product just not for jobs that will take 1 hour or more side note you cant use it while charging either,-,very good,very good,-,very good
i was nervous at first that it wasnt going to be great because it was so cheap but its been fabulous helps clean with out breaking my back i love it it turns off if you put too much pressure on it but will turn right back on,very good,very good,-,-,very good
so it definitely does the job my tub looks much better than before definitely will save my back from killing me trying to clean my bathtub,-,-,-,-,-
usually gadgets online have some issue i didnt expect but this is not only as described but it cleans well and without leaning over i cleaned the bathtub yesterday the easiest this task has ever been i will use it next with the pointed brush to do corners and the top of wainscoting etc  also i look forward to finally being able to really clean the bathroom floor including the grout and around the toilet,-,very good,-,-,very good
i cleaned the grout in my bathroom my tile floor in a jiffy the scrubber is powerful  i did have a problem when i could not remove the scrubber brush in order to replace it with another brush  i emailed customer service and within 12 hours amy at leebein responded  when i wrote back that i tried with all my might to pull the brush off the unit she wrote back that she will send a replacement scrubber asap  fabulous customer service and fabulous machine,-,-,-,-,-

"i have seen this type of tool advertised in various blogs over the past few years but it seemed like it was limiting and also harmful on many types of fabrics for the longest time i was using a vacuum and lint rollers to remove fur but eventually realized it wasnt doing enough it wasnt getting the fur that was deeper ingrained and wanted to get deep clean on my carpet and couches

so there are a dozen variations and types and they all pretty much are the same thingthe metal teeth that grabs the hair getting this one was purely based on price cuz i didnt want to pay a lot and it not work and waste money i also liked that it was smaller than some of the ones out there and gave it a chance

its very sturdy the handle has a rubber grip that attracts fur hair very easily ugh and the head of the tool the magic part of this product is the perfect size for me it definitely gets hair thats embedded deep in carpet and cloth couches and i have cats also digs out bits of litter that the vacuum missed

ive tried this tool on various types of fabrics and it works best on carpet that has a tight weave or very short and taut i found that the weave of any cloth will affect the effectiveness of this tool any loose weaves will catch on the metal teeth and possibly damage the fabric or create snags i also found that if the fabric is too loose this tool is useless so i have to create a very flat/tight surface in order to get any hair it works well on felt as well i like that it can get into smaller spaces and is easier to maneuver with it on different types of furniture

i tried this on different types of blankets again hit or miss depending on the weave of the fabric i also tried this on my cat towersmine are mostly made of a larger weave so the teeth catch on those vs grabbing the hair so not very helpful on my cat towers it could be this particular tool and a similar type might work better not sure

despite some downsides i will say its still beneficial for most of my furniture with fabric on it not perfect but definitely worth the price",very good,very good,very good,-,very good

the seller has a message in box that says they donate 1 of their profit to st jude childrens hospital  the price was 53  im guessing their profit was about 5 so 1 is 05  subtracting 5 cents for the good cause leaves net price of 5295  so price per box of kleenex is 293  at a physical cvs or walgreens store price for same box of 230 tissues costs at least 399 so the price is reasonable though not great  the box it came in was undamaged though perhaps packed a bit too tightly  ordered it on saturday got it wednesday late morning ie after 4 days,very good,very good,very good,very good,very good

our city is requiring us to compost all the trash and they gave each resident a countertop trash can these fit perfect and thank goodness because who wants to clean out those trash cans as often as they would need for a family of 5? they are super thin though so anything thats too wet they do get weak so we double bag but its worth it so we dont have a big mess on the way to bringing it out to our greenwaste trash they have no drawstring or anything of course so to keep them on our can we use chip clips to hold them on there and it works for us also the perforation isnt the best and so you dont damage wasting even more bags do yourself a favor and just pull out the roll precut on the perforation stack and reroll and put back in box that 10 min task is worth your sanity when using them and you go to tear one off and accidentally rip through two poorly but we will definitely be buying again because it does the job,-,very good,-,very good,very good

this is a battery operated bug zapper that actually zaps bugs the only caveat is when you charge it from a wall outlet via the usb c cord that comes with it it charges up completely and works all night however the solar cell is not big enough or of the wrong configuration and it  even on very sunny days  will not charge up enough to give you more than 3  4 hours of zapping other than that a great bug zapper and no electric cord necessary  which is great,-,very good,very good,-,very good
this bug zapper definitely works  each time i set it out next morning i have a load of bug carcasses to clean out the small brush included for cleaning purposes is not up to this task  i use a yard blower to blow all the dead bugs away  the solar panel alone isnt sufficient for a full battery charge you really have to plug it into wall power to get a full charge which last for about six hours i had it in mind that perhaps you could set this in the sun and it would automatically recharge each day and turn itself back on at night alas this is not the way it works you have to remember to press the bug zapper button each time you want it to start the zapping i have not used the light yet but i imagine that if this were to be used while camping in a tent that it would generate sufficient battery power from sunlight to provide some light and some bug killing ability inside the tent it probably wouldnt last for more than an hour or two but that would be enough to kill all the bugs inside the tent  can it be improved?  yes but it would probably add so much to the cost that you wouldnt want to buy it for the price and the quality and the good job that it does i think it is a good buy,good,good,good,-,good

"i recently had the pleasure of trying out the solar bug zapper by kiies and i must say it has been a gamechanger for our family this portable bug zapper not only kept the annoying mosquitos at bay but also impressed us with its userfriendly design and worryfree operation

first and foremost one of the standout features of this bug zapper is its lightweight and compact design it is incredibly easy to carry around and set up wherever needed both indoors and outdoors we particularly loved how it fit perfectly in our window soaking up the suns rays and charging its battery ensuring it was always ready to go when we needed it

"3 stars for now
just getting started with this zapper so far the battery life is not good just a few hours we have it plugged into a charger for use now and we shall see how it goes
downgrading to a 2
after a week we are sending it back while it does kill bugs the battery is so weak that it will not stay on more than a few hours
we received a response from the seller that the battery must have been defective i am upgrading to 4 stars and hope that others have a better experience than ours",-,bad,-,-,bad
"updated review 05/09/2023

so i wanted to update my review because of the sellers quick action to make everything write even though i didnt get another item they were very responsive to my review and instantly wanted to do whatever they could to make it up to me so my battery was actually a faulty one so please disregard the statement about the battery life in this device i have to say it was really nice being able to talk to an actual human on the other end of things especially one that cared about my frustration with the product and wanted to make everything write so i would leave a happy customer and they did just that i want to wish them the best of luck at their new business and i hope others will do the same

old review
i was excited to receive this product because i thought would be a great way to save time and energy but that was not the case but i will say they are perfect for camping my issue with us was the battery life is too short and there is no automated turn on and off switch the side light would drain the battery so ive never use it but on the bright side is the light is pretty bright lol i felt like i was charging this more than i was actually using it to kill bugs maybe if it had more of a remote switch to it so i wasnt walking all the way out to every day to charge it and to turn it on",-,very good,very good,-,very good

the buggy situation is even worse this year after historical 10 storms we experienced in california
fortunately i found this nice portable bug zapper that helps keeping those pests at bay

after almost 2 months of usage here are some pros that i have to give credits when credits due

1 solarpowered with rechargeable battery as backup power source

 when hanging outside with direct sunlight exposure this zapper will completely operate on its own without having to be recharged via usb
 when hanging under roof without sun two hours of recharge via usb is all it needs to last whole day/night long

2 cordless lightweight and kid/pet safe construction

 without additional wires and with its lightweight design it is super easy to carry around and to hang over tree/wall or just put it on picnic table

 it is also lightweight and the shield net leaves plenty space to keep our children and pets safe

3 it is super satisfying to hear the zap sound during twilight hours and enjoy bugfree nights for both inhome and camping

my pros  easy to charge and light weight battery operated so i can move it around when its in the way i didnt have to have it next to an outlet came with a brush that i could easily clean off the fruits of its labor i didnt have to plug it in halfway through the evening since it had charged all day long we used the lamp to look for a lost watch when it had gotten dark and we wanted to go back inside very convenient

cons  the carrying handle tends to come loose but it is easy to put it back on the lamp is convenient but could be brighter",-,very good,very good,very good,very good

"these melemine eracers are so much better than any other that ive tried especially than a certain mrs these have much more magic than those

so much more durable so much thicker and so many more for a 10th of the price of magic mans erasers

often i end up cutting them in half and they still last so long

 if i want a little extra clean i  what them and rub them on  a regular bar of white soap just a little bit and it cleans amazingly well
great for cleaning kicks/sneakers/tennis shoes  especially the white sole

when i want a little more clean i will  wet and rub on a bar of lava soap

some people like to add dish soap but i find that its too sudsy and i feel like i have to clean up after cleaning up

then there are times when i want to clean off electronic things like wires  the metal parts of plugs  i unplug first from electricity then i use rubbing alcohol instead of water to get them wet and it works just as well and i dont have to worry about rusting anything and it dries really quickly

i dont use them for tv computer tablet or phone screens  i found that with alcohol it almost makes them too clean if that makes sense",very good,very good,very good,-,very good

i ordered the yocada b098dx1vd6 1699 and the clean home b09gf2lsz8 for 1899  i would venture to say these are made in the exact same factory  yocada may have slightly stiffer bristles but my husband and i disagree on this  make your choice based on color aesthetic and if you value the microfiber cloth  that is the 200 difference clean home packaging has more colorful packaging with nice promo material within  the only reason i did not give 5 stars all the way is that i wish we it could be shorter which would make it even easier for me to clean the free standing tub  it is the length that was advertised  because i wanted the microfiber preferred the orange color and appreciated the better packaging to give as a gift i kept the clean home version  but you cant go wrong here either,very good,-,-,very good,very good
i used this for stripping my vinyl floors before waxing  it was fantastic  i got the floor brush also they came in a bundle which i almost didnt need except that the floor brush has a great squeegee side for wiping the stripper off the floor  as for scrubbing i actually preferred the tub brush  i decided to get them both to use the tub brush for hard to reach places like behind the toilet in corners and under cupboards  it worked great for those areas but also great everywhere else  ive got a good system now for stripping and waxing my floors every 6 months  and now i will probably actually do it every 6 months,-,very good,-,-,very good

"tried these instead of the thinner brown towels made by the same

the case even though being far lower in case count for number of towels has proved to last over twice as long  the better absorbance has allowed for the use of fewer towels bringing the total cost over time down

one thing that i think is worth noting is than when these towels are wet the paper includes a small amount of tiny black/grey fibers that at first glance might appear to be dust from a surface that you wiped but are in fact just part of the paper towel  i wiped that surface more times than i care to admit before i realized this xd",very good,very good,very good,-,very good
"not long ago i bought a tork xpress holder for my main bathroom and two cases of these multifold white paper hand towels

after seeing the holder and towels in the bathroom of a very nice restaurant i decided to do some research to see if i could find the same product i am glad i did because i found them right here on the amazoncom website

folks i dont know about you but i am not always comfortable when visiting friends or family and trying to find something to dry my hands in their bathrooms  i started thinking about it and decided to give the guests in my home an option to use these absorbent 16 inch durable paper towels to dry their hands instead of the decorative towels and other hand towels and bath towels

more often than not i now use these relatively inexpensive paper towels more often than i use my cloth hand towels some might think that this contributes to a larger carbon footprint however in these times when deadly viruses are rampant i feel like this easily reloadable product provides a confidence that it is a cleaner alternative for guests and family to use

i recommend this product to family friends and others who are looking for a clean and confident alternative to hand towel in your guest bathrooms

ive loved these wipes since i first started buying them however my last shipment is in new packaging that makes it almost impossible to get the towlettes out withouth tearing them the old packaging had a large hole which is required to remove these large wipes without issue the new packaging cuts that hole size in half the towlettes tear every time orthey cling to each other requring you to cut the packaging to get out the clump of towlettes that are sticking together i understand wanting to save money on packaging but you have to make the hole big enough to access the product ill probably be having to find a different brand bc of this frustration even though i really think they are the best wipes on the market,neutral,neutral,neutral,neutral,neutral

so incredibly handy and helps reach all those tight spots and crevices the sponge or dishwasher does not  we use a lot of protein and supplement powders in our sealed bottles/containers and it used to be hard to get those tight spaces around the collapsible straws but not anymore  as a bonus i promise your cats will love these too,-,very good,-,very good,very good

i got these straw cleaners to clean my straws and they have held up nicely they are a bit hard to hold while cleaning the inside of the straw but it gets the job done so far i have used only one and i have the rest to use so i dont think i will be running out of them anytime soon i clean them after with hot water and soap so that i can continue to reuse them i wish that the stick on the other end would be a bit stronger because  it is hard to clean it when it is wobbly and not firm for the amount they give you in my opinion it is a good deal you are able to keep these for a while without always having to stock up on these cleaners which i loved anywhere else these cleaners are going to be more expensive and the possibility of having to constantly have to repurchase them which can become expensive as time goes by the brush on the cleaner does do a good job it cleans well when you swirl it in the straw to make sure it stays clean after using it,very good,very good,very good,-,very good

"these melemine eracers are so much better than any other that ive tried especially than a certain mrs these have much more magic than those

so much more durable so much thicker and so many more for a 10th of the price of magic mans erasers

often i end up cutting them in half and they still last so long

 if i want a little extra clean i  what them and rub them on  a regular bar of white soap just a little bit and it cleans amazingly well
great for cleaning kicks/sneakers/tennis shoes  especially the white sole

when i want a little more clean i will  wet and rub on a bar of lava soap

some people like to add dish soap but i find that its too sudsy and i feel like i have to clean up after cleaning up

then there are times when i want to clean off electronic things like wires  the metal parts of plugs  i unplug first from electricity then i use rubbing alcohol instead of water to get them wet and it works just as well and i dont have to worry about rusting anything and it dries really quickly

if you are buying these for your trip you should be careful you dont fold them or you cant take them out easily they are fragile and any fold can make headache for you to use them later i tore some of them also when you are using them you should be gentle it is soft but they really are fragile overall it does the job,-,good,-,-,good

"im very pleased with zfitei bug zapper it does an excellent job in catching any bug/mosquitoes glad i decided to give it a try because i originally was looking for a replacement bulb  for my other zapper this one is a little bigger than the one i had which is good reasonable price and perfect for my need i would recommend to friends/family

update to my previous review

i guess it was too soon to speak today may 11 exactly a month later i received it it stopped working the light doesnt work i noticed a few days ago the light was flickering briefly however today it just stopped i attached a picture to proof what im talking about you can see its plugged in the outlet with no light

i sent to the seller an email with picture attached to resolve this issue and so far nobody contacted me if i dont hear from seller for a resolution ill return it and would like a refund

from being a happy customer now im really disappointed and for this reason ill change my rate to star️star️

hopefully ill get the sellers attention with my new review and contact me

i will post the new outcome",very good,very good,-,-,very good
i bought this for mosquitoes but it really didnt help the problem i had with it compared to other bug zappers i owned in the past its not real strong a small ladybug for example fried for several minutes and would not finish it should be a few pops and done i would not recommend this for larger bugs,-,bad,-,-,bad

best bug zapper i have ever purchased we take it camping and set it to the side and we dont get any bugs at all i have bought 3 i have also given the site to 4 others that saw it and they also purchased some great product fir the price,very good,-,-,-,very good
works really really well but you should buy octenol baits if you want to catch mosquitos since they arent attracted to bug lights alone,-,poor,-,-,poor

"my mother used to always keep one of these in the cars cupholder when i was a child unlike todays generation we didnt actually eat or drink in the car back then they are easy to use and open its lifespan decreases the more it is opened however the more it is opened the more smell is produced

this one smells like hawaii specifically my first image was of myself on a beach applying tropical suntan lotion and sipping a pina colada it has a wonderful scent that instantly transports you

this is a fantastic technique to mask odors i purchased it for my sons pickup he works in a factory and when he leaves work he just stinks his odor also causes the vehicle to stink this is benefiting them both it appears that some of the tropical odor lands on his clothes",-,very good,-,-,very good

was supposed to receive 2 but only got 1  not going to get overly excited about a 124 mess up as it was part of a big delivery and the box came damaged  anyway this is a very nice scent as im trying out all the glades through amazon  this is my favorite so far,-,-,very good,very good,very good
drys out to fast though,-,-,-,-,-
i love the scent of this i use it for a small bedroom and it makes the entire room smell fantastic,-,very good,-,-,very good
i really love these but they dont last very long wish they made them last longer and with a stronger scent,-,very good,-,-,very good
i like these because ty jier convenient and you can put them just about anywhere but the last few times i purchased them they arent very potent smelling like they used to be you used to be able to smell themtjrew the package even and when opened it would smell up your room good but now you cant smell them threw the package very well and they arent very smelly once opened either,-,very good,very good,very good,very good
i really like these glade pop up solids the fragrance is nice not overly powerful and a great bargain i stopped buying them for a few months because they were arriving with broken tops and it wasnt the packaging despite being in a secure box with plastic cushioning tops were completely undone and the gel inside was damaged also the cone would not remain in an upright position when trying to use my last purchase of 6 all went directly in the trash but i decided to give them another try and my most recent order of 6 arrived intact undamaged and completely fine the hawaiian breeze smells like spring and sunshine and was a great value with this order i am a happy camper,very good,very good,-,very good,very good

i bought these a handful of times with budget money they are tall enough to keep most people happy that they didnt get stuck with a small cup they last a long time if you dont get to enjoy your drink right away the cover keeps liquids warm but it is not spillproof i feel like its a better value if everyone who uses each cup uses a cover because there are less expensive sets without covers and when all is said and done only about 50 of the covers got used in our case regardless of pricing theyre great quality,very good,very good,very good,very good,very good
i injured my back and its been hard to clean the bathtub in other areas of the house so i researched and found this product took their suggestion and did the pink paste and i will tell you yesterday took less than five minutes to clean the bottom of my tub that i could not get clean due to the injured back so this is going to be a lifesaver im going to use it everywhere is light its easy to use your charger from the wall with a usb and all the additional doctors are going to really help me get my house in order i will say when you have an injure back and its hard to literally put your back into it this is the lifesaver you need its not loud light way and i wish i thought about it sooner to look into this you wont regret this purchase,-,very good,-,-,very good
"i have a thing for cleaning but i also have a weak back  i dislike getting on my knees as well

with this device i dont have to do any of it  it extends far enough for me to be able to reach about anywhere without having to stand in the shower where i throw bleach  its also strong enough where i dont have to press down with pressure  the brush heads they provided are more than enough for almost about everything  i use the buff pads for detailing my car  very versatile

this is in my top 5 cleaning devices  its easy to use  i love that it uses a typec cable to charge  its very easy to clean the brush heads as well  i usually soap it a bit then throw in my small bucket of hot water and let it spin  comes out clean  then i run it so it can air itself

i love this purchase  hoping to find larger buff head attachments where i can buy separately",-,very good,-,-,very good
ive been wanting one of these since i saw a version of this on tv years ago and ran across this portable scrubber i tried it out a few days ago and it literally cut my cleaning time in half i hit the kitchen and bathroom right before lunchtime and was done with both rooms in less than an hour sinks floors tile and even the chrome fixtures came out super clean and shiny i even got rid of some stains in the sinks which i thought would never go away would definitely recommend this scrubber to anyone who values their time and has better things to do than to spend the morning cleaning and polishing great little time saver,very good,very good,very good,-,very good
it took at least 6 months looking at products that would help me clean my bathrooms and kitchen reason being my kitchen countertop and island are all tilestone tile with grout as well as my bathroom floors tub and shower walls my sundays are consumed with cleaning themi i kept this product on my wish list for a few weeks and watch the reviews come in high i decided it was worth the purchase grinning face  it does everything it promises and much more and gave me more time to enjoy my weekend  i am very impressed with the  charge and how long it last and all the attachment tools it comes this is the second reason i purchased it it comes with a wide variety of tool that does what i purchased it for down to the car tires plus you can order replacements i love it,-,very good,very good,-,very good
i needed a good shower scrubber that would extend that so that i would not have to bend over so much i love this scrubber it comes with so many different pads the led interface is great and it even speaks to you so you know what speed you are at i like that it comes with different speeds and it makes cleaning my shower a breeze something i hate doing on a regular basis also its great for getting out hard on stains in the bathroom floor left over by kitty hes old and makes a mess so no more hands and knees scrubbing,-,very good,-,-,very good
really like the extension wand that allows fast cleaning of shower walls quickly charged up and has lots of power even on lowest setting like the variety of brushes and availability to reorder additional  brushes when needed i do wish the power section went into the wand a bit easier i wasnt sure at first if i had it in place would highly recommend purchasing for those who want to super clean your house without having to bend over or get in hands and knees to scrub,-,very good,-,-,very good
makes cleaning the shower much easier no stretching with the extension handle  also used it to clean the grout lines in my kitchen floor  i sprinkled soda and hydrogen peroxide on the grout  let it set a few minutes and use the pointed scrub brush and with little effort wow grout clean again  the power and speed is good and the battery length is good,-,very good,-,-,very good

i have been using this toilet paper for about 6 months now i started out from scratch not knowing which brand to buy  of coarse i started out with the cheapest one available and then went from there as the saying goes you get what you pay for in these days a person needs to try and keep their budget as low as possible but for me i also count on quality of the product i dont want my hand going through the toilet paper when wiping and i dont want the paper to scrape off my butt skin  when i finally bought this brand reel i was really satisfied with the product  i will always stick with this brand of toilet paper and to save money i do “subscribe and save “ method that way i save some money its like being on sale at the store i highly recommend this product to anyone,very good,very good,-,-,very good

first time ordering a bamboo tp and had no expectations what drew me to them was the sustainability no plastic threeply they are amazing i cannot recommend this product enough they have no flyaway residual fibers floating around every time you pull the roll like regular tp they are strong but also very soft even the actual roll itself is made of sturdy bamboo that kids could certainly find fun uses for in art projects its a little pricey but what it delivers makes it completely worth it,very good,very good,very good,-,very good
feels a little heavier compared to most toilet papers which is fine with me considering it doesnt tear as easy when wiping the only grudge i have is the regular price bamboo products are suppose to be cheaper to make and sold as an alternative at same prices or less not always the case but i took advantage of the sale and i really like the product,very good,-,-,-,very good

"i just bought and received my second 60 pack it lasted me over a year so im doing great at less than one bag per week for two adults heres everything you need to know

only fits simple human garbage cans i got the best one 110 sold at my local bed bath  beyond so start there they have a secret lifetime warranty on all products this steel can has lasted me almost 10 years i broke all the plastic ones
like any can mine can be a pain to clean dont make a mess in your can
these bags only fit cans of size p a size only made by simple human
the bags fill my can about 95 i can pack it in but risk breaking the bag so i pull it out at 95 or less
the bags are still annoying to put in but at least my can has an insert with a hole the excess bag stuffs into to hold it in when inserting the bag it still takes work to keep the bag from bunching up
draw strings work
scentless thank you
not extra durable by any means durability is due to garbage bag plastic thickness measured in mils typically this bag is the same as all premium white kitchen garbage bags the only bags thicker are black outdoor garbage bags like contractor bags

the head worked great for what i needed however one arrived broke about halfway down the stick the other i tried to use on the stick but maybe i used too much force to cleanbut it couldnt hold up and also broke but the product does work great and got rid of the buildup on toilets sinks tubs and doesnt leave any scratches that you have to buff out or anything i would buy again but i wouldnt buy the ones on the sticks they just cant take the pressure,-,very good,-,-,very good
although they arrived broken i was able to use pieces to remove a hard water stain from my toilet that has been irritating my soul,-,bad,-,-,bad
never even knew these existed i found them on accident looking for tub resurfacing stuff and a few reviews i read made me try them out i went with this brand because they were cheaper couldnt be any happier barely any pressure applied and my ring came right off my pictures show how much was used to clear up my ring finish doesnt look scratched feels smooth and is as glossy as the other untouched areas ill always keep one of these in stock now its like a magic eraser got some spots in the tub and the other toilet too so i gotta go get busy,bad,bad,-,-,bad

"i got my hands on this dish soap a while back like around 2 months ago and let me tell you its been nothing short of amazing first off it smells awesome and since i usually wash dishes with my bare hands i have to say that it feels pretty darn good on the skin too no irritation whatsoever which is a huge plus

but heres the real kicker ive been washing a crazy amount of dishes every single day and after 2 months ive only gone through like 2530 of the whole bottle its like this soap has magical powers when it comes to lasting and scrubbing seriously you only need a tiny bit of it to tackle a mountain of dirty dishes

sure it might be a little more expensive than the average dish soap but trust me its worth every penny i highly highly recommend it",very good,very good,-,very good,very good

"love these so far  some reviewers have noticed that ebl batteries arent demonstrating lsd performance  lsd lowself discharge is very important if you put batteries in a flashlight laser sight or survival radio and need to forget about it for 35 years and still expect the batteries to have the majority of battery life remaining when you need to use the device

on my sartorius 1574 scientific scale with 01g accuracy i get the following battery weights

ebl aaa 1100 mah nimh batteries weigh 1349g
amazon basics 800 mah black made in japan aaa 1148g
eneloop aaa placeholder havent weighed these yet

we have 7 and 9 year old boys  we have a house full of r/c cars transmitters rokenbok trains toys and flashlights walkytalkies and other devices  our batteries get recharged after every use remote control cars typically because most things we use them in are high drain and rarely sit in the battery box waiting to be used very long  while we also use rechargeable batteries in our wireless mac keyboard and mouse as well as all the remote controls  honestly lsd is just not a relevant feature and reviews like the one from nlee the engineer going so far as saying ebl batteries are deceptive marketing just arent relevant to us  at all  we want rechargeable batteries that can be recharged bunches of times with good capacity

with rechargeable batteries they are engineered as a compromise and balance of

capacity how many mah minimum and typical
cycles  of times the batteries can be recharged
selfdischarge rate loss of mah as batteries sit longer as a function of time

you can purchase batteries that are exceptional in any one aspect  eneloop pros are a great battery if you need max mah capacity and are willing to have batteries that only promise about 500 charge cycles before failure  these work great in cameras to say take pictures over a whole hour and half soccer game but youll be throwing them away sooner  you get batteries like the eneloop or amazon basics black made in japan  with exceptional lsd characteristics that are great if you need rechargeable batteries that will be there when you need them survival flashlight after several years  lsd characteristic is a function of what percentage of the mah rating is available after the battery has sat on a shelf or unused in a device for so many months/years  however both eneloop regular and amazon basics black made in japan have lower capacity mah as a tradeoff compared to ebl or eneloop pro  they do offer more recharge cycles than eneloop pro and better lsd or charged shelf life than ebl  if you want great rechargeable aaa batteries with exceptional capacity even above the 1100 mah rating and exceptional number of recharge cycles you cant beat ebl for the price

eneloops sell 8pack for 1786 or 223 each 2100 recharges 70 charge after 10 years 800 mah 750 mah minimum
amazon basics sell for 1199 or 149 each over 1000 recharges 800 mah 750 mah minimum
ebls sell 16pack for 1699 or 106 each 1200 recharges 1100 mah claims 75 charge after 3 years

again the disputed lsd characteristics of rechargeable batteries have zero value to our family  we want good value a high number of recharge cycles and good battery capacity  our favorite batteries right now are ebl our second favorites are amazon basics only the black  made in japan and our 3rd favorites are eneloop  we like tenergy too  at less than half the price of panasonic eneloops and higher capacities weve been choosing ebl lately  for our needs and we dont need lsd shelf life as we typically put freshly charged batteries in anything that needs batteries and for the price we dont even consider paying a premium for eneloop anymore and the black amazon basics made in japan are lower in capacity and higher in price

remember you can have great capacity cycles or lsd characteristics but not a good combination of two of the three and certainly not a good combination of all three  the higher the capacity of the battery mah typically the fewer the number of recharge cycles  eneloop pros can only be charged 1/4 as many times a normal eneloops  the better the lsd  lowself discharge rate typically you have to sacrifice either recharge cycles or capacity usually both  the higher the number or recharge cycles typically you are getting less capacity and diminished lsd performance  pick whats important to you

do the aa batteries in our mac wireless keyboard run out sooner using ebl batteries that have higher capacity but lower lsd shelf life i honestly dont know  who counts keystrokes?  we dont pay attention to whether its been three weeks or seven weeks when we replace the aa batteries in our mac wireless mouse or keyboard  we absolutely love the ebl batteries because they meet our needs

they have the best capacity mah compared to eneloops and amazon basics black made in japan
they are sold at the best price point
they can be recharged cycles either as often as the eneloops or the amazon basics

with two young boys under 10 years old we use three different panasonic eneloop smart chargers and an ebl multicell smart charger to keep our rechargeable dcell aa  and aaa batteries ebl tenergy amazon basics black made in japan charged  running r/c cars  or rokenbok we can blow through a ton of batteries in an afternoon and we dont want to wait to just charge batteries 4 at a time a small r/c car an transmitter can use x2 aaa batteries in the transmitter and x3 in the car  our batteries are typically left in things like tv remotes or wireless mouse and keyboard for the mac for months  when batteries get low we recharge them  we prioritize recharge cycles and capacity and pay attention to value  i cant imagine how infinitesimal the value of lsd battery functionality would be for our family for our usage  what would be the value of lsd batteries at a tradeoff of fewer recharge cycles over the battery lifespan or lower capacity mah?  lasting another couple of hours or another day in the mac mouse or keyboard?

all things being equal like price wed always buy eneloops  however pricepoints arent the same and when we need more batteries we are finding ourselves recognizing the exceptional value of ebl batteries and ordering more ebls every time  the only batteries we like price considered on par with ebl batteries are tenergy

pay attention to ebl capacity ratings

ebl makes batteries in different mah ratings in both aa and aaa  with the higher capacity mah rating you get longer lasting batteries per use just like eneloop pro batteries but you also get fewer recharge cycles just like the difference between eneloop pro and eneloop batteries  pick the ebl batteries that give you the best combination of maximum number of recharge cycles with good capacity mah  if you choose the max capacity mah ebl cells for that battery size aa or aaa youre essentially buying eneloop pro batteries  high performance batteries with exceptional capacity with fewer recharge cycles before battery failure  the best compromise to find that regular eneloop best of both worlds is to make sure you never buy the max capacity ebl cells in a given size  same with tenergy blues vs tenergy premiums  same as eneloop pro vs eneloop

my two cents",very good,very good,very good,very good,very good
"update someone contacted me and offered a full refund  i had experimented with old batteries  these batteries  discovered that if i did not push battery all the way into the slot then they worked  i said 50 refund was adequate since i could use batteries in 1 speaker with no problem and in the other speaker if i loaded it carefully
initial review i purchased ebl aaa batteries in dec 2022  i did not need them until april 2023  i put them in over the ears speakers but they did not work  i charged them and retried them  they still did not work  i charged them again and retried them today apr 30 2023  they still did not work  i tried them on one speaker and used an older amazon basics battery  it did work  i fiddled with all of them and determined that the positive pole is not making good contact and will not stay on  i have no problem with the 4 amazon basics batteries that ive been using for more than a year  now i find out that it is too late to return them  this sucks  batteries are something that you order for the future and do not test out until needed",-,neutral,-,neutral,neutral

original review  when they worked they worked fine  fully charged battery life was slightly below nonrechargeable average  id equate them amazon basic or rayovac quality not duracell or energizer quality

however of the 16 aaa batteries i originally purchased only 4 of them still charge  the other 12 get errors on every charger i try them on  currently using a nitecore sc4 superb charger and it cant even recognize most of these cells except the 4 that are still working but i dont expect these to last much longer either

since i bought these middle of last year ive probably only discharged and recharged them 68 times total thats it

maybe i got a bad batch who knows?",poor,poor,poor,-,poor

"my felis domesticus eats canned cat food twice a day i generally put the cat food in washable bowls but sometimes i get into a situation where i dont have any bowls because the bowls are soaking in the kitchen sink bowls with dried cat food are easier to clean after soaking in diluted dawn soap for a few hours in those instances i will reach for one of these bowls i feel bad about the potential impact on the environment when i use this versus a washable bowl so i try not to use these unless needed i have to throw these in the trash after use because the recycling service does not accept paper bowls with food waste and i dont have a compost machine i believe you can only compost paper items and veggies no meat

these are pretty strong but the bowl gets weaker over time if i add canned cat food i cannot reuse these each bowl is pretty much a onetime use

i definitely recommend getting a pack of these because they are durable not too large and can be easily thrown away after use its nice to have a stash of paper bowls available if you are in a pinch and dont have any dishes available",-,very good,very good,-,very good

i measured a set of those amazonbasics highcapacity aa batteries using my",-,-,-,-,-
" here are my findings

 right out of the box the average remaining charge was 1204mah or 48 of the rated 2500mah capacity date code on them says 201402 but just like other eneloop batteries they were not fully charged when then left factory

 after just one recharge/discharge cycle the average capacity jumped to 2547mah

 after another two more recharge/discharge cycles the average capacity settled at 2555mah the spread is very tight between 2510 and 2610mah which indicates good quality control

the above behavior is nearly identical to that of the sanyo xx cell which i have previously tested in 2011

mechanically the amazonbasics highcapacity cells appear identical to the sanyo xx refer to the photo i uploaded to the customer images section and you will see that they have exactly the same shape for positive terminals same texture on their wrappers even down to the same vent hole design

"batteries so obviously the amazonbasics version is a great bargain my advice is to grab them  before amazon gets greedy and jacks up the price

one important note
the amazonbasic highcapacity aa or sanyo xx or duracell ion core is fatter than a normalcapacity nimh aa cell which itself is fatter than a typical alkaline aa cell so it may not fit if your appliance has extremely tight battery compartment

update on dec 10 2014
longterm selfdischarge data tested one pair of amazonbasics aa highcapacity batteries after 5 months in storage the average remaining charge is 2175mah or 85 of the original capacity this is even better than my previous 5month test result for sanyo xx batteries which showed 2040mah or 78 of original capacity",very good,very good,-,-,very good

i bought these gloves on may 18th 2022 for washing dishes not only did they keep the water out of my sleeves they also dried quickly it is now may 7th 2023 and the pair i was using every day multiple times a day to wash dishes finally broke if i didnt already dedicate the second pair in the box as chemical cleaning gloves for the house i would have had two years worth of dishes from these gloves a truly worthy investment im buying another pair now,-,good,good,good,good
ive only used these once so far so ill just speak on that i got these for dishes and basic cleaning ive spent so much money buying regular cleaning gloves from common retail stores and within 1 week they always rip/break fairly quickly which is why i went on amazon to find a more durable pair i went with these for the promise of their durability when i put them on i realized they are very thick so thick to the point where i couldnt even feel the dishes i was holding maybe it harder to wash and manage them so i guess the thickness is where the durability comes from because of how thick they are its not easy to hold things or work with your hands with them on but as i get more use to them i think it may get easier over time  but ill also be using these gloves for many other big household cleaning tasks which i think the gloves will work perfectly for the only part that i thought eh was how they are so thick i cant feel what i am holding while i am wearing them but they are worth the price and i suspect they will hold up for much longer than the regular store cleaning gloves i had to buy at least 6 times per month  i put 4 stars for comfort due to having 0 feeling of what your holding while wearing the gloves,very good,very good,very good,-,very good

work as intended these bags work exactly as theyre supposed to  they seal easily and they keep food fresh ive used them to store everything from leftovers to prepped vegetables and ive never had any issues with them

great quantity the fact that this product comes with 90 bags is fantastic its a great value for the price and it means that i dont have to worry about running out of bags anytime soon

cons

none really i have to say that i dont have any major complaints about this product it does exactly what its supposed to do and it does it well
overall i would highly recommend the amazon basics slider gallon food storage bags to anyone in need of a reliable food storage solution the bags work well theyre easy to use and they come in a great quantity whether youre storing leftovers or prepping food in advance these bags are a great choice i cant think of any major cons to this product  it simply works as intended and it does it well",very good,very good,very good,-,very good
i do crafts and am using these bags to keep cut out items separated and organized so for that purpose they are perfect because they are inexpensive however if i were going to use them to store food i probably wouldnt be as generous because they seem quite thin i see that it doesnt list itself as a freezer bag which is what i put in the search bar so thats good and i guess if i were putting a sandwich or cookies or something in it it may be acceptable but i wouldnt trust them for any heavy duty items that being said for my purposes i am quite delighted because i have a large amount of items that i need to separate and label and the quantity i received for the price in addition to the label area on them makes the absolutely perfect for me,very good,very good,-,-,very good

these boveda twoway humidity packs are a must have item for my cigar tupperdors the benefits of using these packs in a tupperdor is that they will last a long time because unlike wooden humidors tupperdors are airtight containers and made of acrylic or plastic i have recharged these pack with great success which means that they can be reused over and over the way i recharged these packs is to use distilled water in an airtight container with a lid and adding a smaller container without a lid that is floating on top of the water with the packs placed in the smaller container that is floating in the distilled water inside the larger container with the lid on this will allow the twoway humidification packs to absorb the moisture from the surrounding humidity and not have direct contact with the water i highly recommend this product,-,very good,very good,very good,very good

the bags are a lightweight plastic so they arent designed to be heavy duty anything with sharp edges could easily cause a puncture i dont think it would be ideal to use these for glass bottles simply because of the amount of weight that would accumulate but these are perfect bags for aluminum and plastic containers overall i think they are going to work well and the size will hold a good amount of recyclables earth buddies rejoice",-,very good,-,very good,very good

"i adopted my maltese piper as a seven year old breeder release from a puppy mill shes adorable and utterly sweet and somewhat housetrained after two years of dedicated effort but she either cant or wont wait until im home from work to do her business when theres business to be done given her history its not a debate ill win she has however graciously agreed to use puppy pads placed by the back door for her convenience its a workable compromise yay

piper is not exactly up on her spatial awareness techniques so she requires ample room to assure that she hits the target the best disposable pads i found in the size that works for her run about 36 for a 50pack for piper that averages to about one months worth of pads so 432 annually thats a lot of money for dog pee and poop management along with a veritable mountain of yuck in the nearest landfill bear in mind that most dogs housetrain just fine and dont need an annual budget for this my chihuahuamix teddy insisted on being in the photo but would absolutely die of embarrassment if he piddled in the house he wanted you to know that

after crunching the numbers a little over a year ago i bought both the happy paw pads and another brand of washable pads through amazon to see how they performed the other brands pads are considerably larger and correspondingly more expensive and have a plastic backing while the happy paw pads have a cloth backing

i used both brands together since having one of each on the floor slightly overlapped gave piper plenty of space to do her thing and made for a fair test of both products she used them both equally and preferred them to the disposable pads which are so much thinner

my expectation was that the larger pads would work best for pipers needs however constant washing three or four times a week really started to take a toll on the backing over time until there were dozens of small splits that have finally begun to allow some of the wet to leak through i also noticed that the plastic backed pads tended to bunch up and created a tripping hazard while the happy paws pads stayed nice and flat i can open the back door with enough clearance over the happy paws pads but not the other brand

to be honest both pads are great as far as saving money the happy paws cost 23 while the other brand cost 35 for a combined expenditure of 58 even though the larger ones wore out they still held up for about a year thats a cumulative savings of 374 in puppy pads last year yes theres time and expenditure for washing them but if you have a washing machine its still a very significant saving

best yet the happy paws pads show absolutely no signs of wear or tear although i considered replacing the larger pads i decided to buy a second pack of the happy paws to add to the rotation instead and so far that seems to be working out fine ill add a photo of an old and new one together good luck telling which one is which

a few pros and cons

pros
 theyre extremely durable and hold up to lots and lots and lots of washing
 theyre absorbent enough to accommodate a 20 lb malteses extracurricular potty activities
 they pay for themselves very quickly in comparison to disposable pads
 no stinky garbage cans or landfill burden
 did i mention theyre durable?

cons
 as has been mentioned in other reviews the color and pattern can make it hard to see if theyve been used inspecting under bright light helps
 they require washing so more labor intensive than disposable
 if you have a larger dog or one with poor aim youd be well advised to put multiple pads down and overlap them a bit piper tends to need two if happy paws came in a larger size id definitely buy them
 i cant vouch for how much moisture these pads will hold for a larger dog i havent discovered any leakage in over a year of constant use but ill stop short of saying they wont leak under enough load of course that applies to all puppy pads
 since they dont have a plastic or rubber backing they can slide around a bit

in summation the happy paws pads work they last a long time they hold up to washing like a champ and if you need puppy pads over the long term they will absolutely save you money",very good,very good,very good,very good,very good
"i really didnt expect much from this product  i have a problem in my basement with fungus gnats because i keep my earthworms down here for my lizard and i also forage a lot of materials bringing the gnats in with all of the leaves and bark etc  theyve been driving me crazy for the last 3 months i have the yellow traps everywhere the only time i caught any with those was when i smacked the gnats with the glue board i decided to just see if there were any on this new trap because one just flew past me i expected an empty trap this photo is just 24 hrs after installation partying facepartying facepartying face some of them were still wiggling around on the board it gets 5 stars from me

"i bought a few different kinds of this type of product one didnt work at all i think the sticky pads werent sticky enough but the others seemed to have one thing about them that made them stand out

this is a small plugin with a moderate light ive learned that the bigger it is and the brighter the light the more and bigger bugs you will get
so if you do have tiny fruit flies very small like tiny moths or little flies from having plants like i did this will work
imo not exceedingly great for mosquitoes and definitely not regular flies

"ive been a longtime user of oxo products and when i needed to get new refills for my oxo good grips soap dispensing palm brush i decided to give these oxo steel refills a try overall they do the job but there are a few things to be aware of before purchasing

first the good news these brush refills are relatively easy to replace just twist off the old one and twist on the new one and they work well for cleaning dishes without scratching nonstick surfaces the soft comfortable grip of the brush is also a plus as it stays nonslip even when wet

now the notsogreat news these refills are designed for the newer steel version of the palm brush and might not fit older models perfectly some users have mentioned needing to cut off tabs to make them compatible if you have an older brush be prepared to do some diy modification or consider upgrading to the newer model also the bristles on these refills are softer compared to the older whitebristle version which may be a pro or con depending on your cleaning preferences

in summary while these oxo steel refills come with minor flaws they are still a handy and effective tool for dishwashing just doublecheck your brush model before purchasing and keep in mind the softer bristles with these caveats in mind i still find these refills to be a useful addition to my kitchen cleaning arsenal",-,very good,very good,very good,very good
i was very disappointed to find that the oxo refill suddently no longer fit my palm brush that i had for years even though i had the oxo steel one already  i bought a new palm brush just to have the refills work they evidently redesigned them without making that clear  but to my very pleasant surprise this brush works much better  i always thought that dispensing the soap only worked well when it was full and i had to push really hard sometimes to dispense the soap even when it was almost full but now with this one the top pushes down much more easily to dispense soap and i actually dont have to refill it until it is basically empty  so now im glad that i had to get a new one,-,very good,very good,very good,very good

"i received the mop in the mail and was ready to mop and super excited i have been wanting one for a while sadly when i opened it up and started to use it i found the handle was broken it would not spin i called customer service but they were closed
i sent an email and put it all back in the box assuming they would tell me to send it back

the next day customer service had contacted me and i gave them the serial number instead of telling me to throw it away or ship it back they told me that quality control wanted to see what was wrong with it and how it broke they sent me out a replacement with a shipping label to mail the broken part to quality to inspect it

to me that shows me that this company actually cares about its products in the past in similar situations i have been told to just throw the broken part away

the product is fine it is a mop  it mops it spins it is sturdy used it with no issues",-,bad,bad,bad,bad

"i recently purchased the hefty ultra strong tall kitchen trash bags and i couldnt be happier with my purchase these trash bags are a gamechanger and have made dealing with household waste a breeze
first and foremost the strength of these bags is impressive they are ultrastrong and can handle even the heaviest loads without tearing or puncturing this has been a lifesaver in my household where we tend to generate a lot of waste
in addition to their strength the tall size of these bags is perfect for our kitchen trash can they easily fit and provide ample room for our waste without spilling over the sides

"the charmount 4 gallon trash bags are a decent option for small bathroom trash cans they offer a convenient size that fits perfectly in these smaller bins allowing for easy disposal of bathroom waste the bags are lightweight and easy to handle which is a plus

man i was so excited for these but they are quite small and what i will say is i had to return them because they are entirely too small for square trash cans if you have any trash cans about the size pictured do not buy  if they are super small like the floral trash can pictures they will work so they are true to size  if you try to force it  they will definitely rip,-,very good,-,-,very good

i ordered the clean home b09gf2lsz8 for 1899 and the yocada b098dx1vd6 1699  i would venture to say these are made in the exact same factory  yocada may have slightly stiffer bristles but my husband and i disagree on this  make your choice based on color aesthetic and if you value the microfiber cloth  that is the 200 difference clean home packaging has more colorful packaging with nice promo material within  the only reason i did not give 5 stars all the way is that i wish we it could be shorter which would make it even easier for me to clean the free standing tub  it is the length that was advertised  i wanted the microfiber preferred the orange color and appreciated the better packaging to give as a gift,very good,-,-,very good,very good

i dont know why i never thought about purchasing a shower brush before but i did it and i dont regret it the older i get the more difficult it is to bend down and scrub the shower the interchangeable heads  make it easy to clean  whether it is the shower or mirrors or walls,-,-,-,-,-
like the way that this goes together easily  reaches deep in the corners of my shower and flattens out to clean the shower walls and ceiling also  only downside ive found is that the expandable handle is hard to tighten enough to keep it from coming too loose which causes the handle to fold up and become short again  but for the price  it gets the job done,good,good,-,-,good
have a glass walled shower and this makes weekly maintenance and cleaning a breeze post shower i scrub down the surfaces corners and walls makes it much wasier,-,-,-,-,-

i bought this after reading the reviews here on amazon i have been previously using the shark steam and scrub steam mop and its starting to sound like its about to break i liked the steam with that mop but it doesnt really scrub and get out the dirt in the individual grains of wood engineered hardwood floors so i went to amazon and found this product i was suprised by the high ratings and decided to try it out ive been looking for a product specifically to clean the wood grains in high traffic areas of my house the package arrived the next day and i started charging it while i was assembling it super easy and i thought the charge was pretty quick i didnt time it though i started using it near my front door and was shocked i used the purple fabuloso love that scent as the floor cleaner and one of the soft bristle attachments go buy this now it has a shorter handle and its pretty small itself so i actually sat down on the ground when using it but it got the dirt out of the wood grain see attached pictures ive been looking for this product and happy with the price very happy with this purchase,very good,very good,very good,very good,very good
recently purchased the jorking cordless power scrubber and i am so happy we did first of all it is lightweight it is easy to charge/assemble and comes with a wide assortment of cleaning brush heads which can be easily changed depending on your cleaning needs these additional cleaning brushes can be stored in the mesh bag that is included in the packaging best of all the scrubber converts to a hand held device if you dont need/want to use the extension rods  i used the scrubber on my shower walls and was really surprised at how effortlessly the task was completed just guide the scrubber and watch it as removes the soap buildup on your walls also once the winter weather broke in the northeast my husband used the scrubber to remove salt residue to clean the soft top on our jeep wrangler and also our tire rims the choice of 3 power speeds is a plus which makes this tool so versatile shipping was very quick and a product guidelines/assembly are easy to follow  this tool is a great purchase  as a side note we had another scrubber that was unreliable had charging issues and despite ordering new batteries  would never keep a charge needless to say that scrubber made it to the trash a long time ago so looking forward to a continued long term use of this product as it has positive results so far,-,very good,very good,very good,very good
the battery lost quite  a long time surprisingly  it cleaned my kitchen floor and bathtub and still had 50 battery left  it did an excellent cleaning  the multiple heads can work with all your cleaning needs  the only thing i found uncomfortable was the handle as it was not long enough to stand up and use  i had to bend over in order to properly use the scrubber,-,good,good,-,good
"we use the product in our bathroom it did an awesome job when using highest setting we had to use both hands

i also use it on my glass stove kitchen top you do have to use the right products though this and the pink product make it shine",-,very good,-,-,very good

i have arthritis and have problems cleaning my bathrooms  this product makes all the difference  so many different cleaning heads  powerful motor and extending handle takes care of all my needs  i no longer dread cleaning the showers  highly recommend it,-,good,-,-,good
this is my 3rd scrubber in the last 12 years  the first 2 had mechanical and charging issues  they were completely made out of plastic so it was hard to attach and detach the extension handle  the charging ports collapsed inside of the handle also so i had to use a screwdriver to pull it out before each charge  you have to charge this scrubber by usb  it doesnt take long to charge and i used 30 of the battery at full throttle for about 20 mins so the battery life is good  the best thing that i like about this scrubber is the extension handle  push up on the button and pull out to extend  this is a good buy if youre looking for a scrubber to use on your bathtub or shower,-,very good,-,-,very good

so for 100 cups i paid 14 i usually buy another brand here for 20 and they come with lids however i wanted to save money because i dont really use the lids and just wanted to see the difference between the two this product is a darker plastic more on the dull side and a little bit shorter but a bit wider from the other ones i used which are crystal clear like glass the lids fit on these 16oz as well no problem there and they are recyclable too pet 1 just like the others maybe they use a little more plastic and thats why its a duller look but its a cup that will be thrown away in a recycle bin but i look a lot at detail like if im throwing a big event or wedding when my guests come over its my ocd and i just like to use the best china silver plastics or whatever lol from a distance the cup looks dirty i added photos and you can see through one and the other is foggy,very good,very good,-,very good,very good

just seriously buy this stuff its so great
i bought it for my best friend too and she adores it
our clothes smell so great",-,very good,very good,-,very good
other name brands definitely have a better quality and the smell lasts much longer  that being said theyre so expensive  these are budget friendly and do help your laundry smell fresh for a few days to a week  i would rather buy this brand and have it last less as long than a name brand for the price  hopefully this helps,very good,very good,-,-,very good
i bought this as a homemade airfreshener 1/4 cup of this mixed with water and a small amount of rubbing alcohol to be mixed in a 32 oz spray bottle this method has worked before as a cheaper alternative to febreeze except arm  hammer purifying waters scent booster smells exactly like your neighborhood laundromat its a strange cloying butfresh clean scent that i probably wouldnt use in my washer but is okay for an alternative to room refreshers one spray on white material and i noticed a blue stain so i wouldnt use this on whites its cheaper than downy or gain or unstoppables,very good,very good,-,very good,very good

"as a longtime zippo lighter enthusiast ive always appreciated the brands quality and reliability however i recently came across the zippo butane jet insert and it has been a complete gamechanger for my lighter experience heres why

easy installation the zippo butane jet insert is designed to fit seamlessly into any standard zippo lighter case the installation process was incredibly simple and took me just a few minutes to complete the inserts compatibility with my existing lighter collection is a huge plus

powerful and windresistant flame the jet insert features a robust and windresistant torch flame which is a significant upgrade from the traditional zippo flame this feature has made it much easier to light up in windy conditions enhancing the overall functionality of my lighter

fuel efficiency ive noticed a considerable improvement in fuel efficiency since switching to the zippo butane jet insert the butane fuel lasts longer than the traditional lighter fluid which means fewer refills and a more ecofriendly option for those looking to minimize their environmental footprint

adjustable flame the insert comes with a handy flame adjustment feature allowing me to customize the flame size to suit my needs this is particularly useful when lighting cigars as it provides the perfect level of control for a precise and enjoyable experience

quality and reliability as expected from a zippo product the butane jet insert is made from highquality materials and built to last the reliability of the insert has made it an indispensable accessory for my zippo lighter collection

safety features the zippo butane jet insert also comes with essential safety features including a childresistant safety button this feature provides an added layer of security ensuring that my lighter can only be used by those who know how to operate it properly

in conclusion the zippo butane jet insert has transformed my zippo lighter experience by offering a powerful and windresistant flame improved fuel efficiency easy installation and customizable flame size if youre a zippo lighter enthusiast looking to enhance your collections functionality i highly recommend giving the zippo butane jet insert a try you wont be disappointed",-,very good,very good,very good,very good
so i really was enjoying my zippo torch bought the canvas carrying case for it and all went golfing and by hole 6 i noticed that the holster for it was no longer on my side i didnt recover my lighter so someone will be a happy person when they find this diamond in the ruff lolflag in hole️ now i need to decide do i buy another one or just stick with a crappy lighter so i dont feel the separation pain when i loose it probably buy another and not the case for it that had a single button to clasp around the belt loop hope this helps your decision on what to buy and what not to buy,-,very good,-,very good,very good
this is a pretty decent insert to replace the traditional zippo insert i tried an off brand one first that had a regular flame and a jet as well that was really awesome but did not work consistently and the lighter died quickly i have hopes for this one lasting longer however the jets do tend to stutter and go out at times i have read other reviews online that indicate the same problem i am hoping it will last with few issues,-,good,good,-,good
amazing insert perfect replacement for the original fuel insert really easy to fill and use works great very constant torch flame amazing alternative to use a zippo with cigars i love it,-,very good,-,-,very good
"this zippo insert is perfect to turn you classy zippo lighter into a modern cigar torch

i quit smoking three years ago and my trusty zippo sat in storage until i bought this i dont regularly smoke anymore but like to enjoy a cigar on the weekend or occasional evening when looking for a decent new cigar torch i stumbled upon this and knew it was for me

as with any cigar torch you will want to buy high quality butane look for something that has been refined more times the higher the refinement the cleaner the burn and the less you will ruin the taste of your cigars i like 14x refined butane but have had some 10x that was just fine

next remember to toast the end of the cigar without drawing on it the high heat of the torch will do this efficiently especially if you roll the cigar back and fourth in your fingers for a more even toast do not puff and do not put the torch directly on the end of the cigar once the end is smoldering begin taking short rapid puffs to draw air into the ember helping bring it to life now your cigar should be burning evenly taste better and last longer puffing with the flame on the end of the cigar can lead to the flame being sucked into the foot causing it to burn prematurely and un evenly this also leads to a spoiled flavor toast gingerly across the tuck then puff lightly and rapidly to build your ember",-,very good,very good,-,very good
the product itself is very high quality as a gift just right especially if you take some cool case for it but there is one caveat  i have been using a lighter for the third year i fill with butane сlipper universal and so the nozzles are constantly clogged i often have to blow through which is not very comfortable i do not think that the problem is in butane most likely something with the nozzles since this problem appeared after a couple of refills of the lighter,-,bad,-,-,bad
i must admit butane lighters can be a real pain to fill all those adapters and the leaked fuel i strongly recommend buying the zippo butane fuel which is made specifically to fill these inserts i love having a zippo lighter that has a straight direct flame that can light my cigar i much prefer this insert over fooling with the cotton the liquid fuel the wick and the flint dont get me wrong i love my old traditional zippos but this is exactly what i needed,-,very good,-,-,very good
this lighter works great for cigars and fireworks what else can i say? ,-,very good,-,-,very good

 theyre relatively inexpensive compared to some similar bags
 serve most of my standard household trash needs just fine
 relieve my conscience a bit

 cons minor
 theyre not as sturdy as some of the name brand trash bags but i didnt expect that  as long as i dont fill them with heavy or sharpcornered items durabilitys not an issue
 moisture will collect on the outside of the bag particularly if its not lining a container that allows for air passage  i switch out the bag that i use for my cats litter box two to three times a week but the dampness seeps through  its not pleasant but neither is cleaning a litter box  not a deal breaker

no complaints checks all the boxes great deal cant beat the price for 2 of them they can be placed on wall off floor made of silicone so does not scratch your bowl or hold all that nastiness in brush bristles has vents in bottom so the water can dril away from the brush and the airflow from vents keeps it dry however i have to say  if your looking for a decor piece in a toilet bowl brush so your bathroom looks classy or mid modern century you may have to keep looking however take it from someone who has lived a long time no one is looking at your toilet bowl brushwoman facepalming,neutral,neutral,neutral,neutral,neutral

my goodness this looks bizarre to someone who is used to those sad ol toilet brushes with the plastic spikes that get bent down and become useless face with tears of joyface with tears of joy but it works really good after you get used to it and convince your brain that its really a toilet brush its almost got an industrial look to it surely it will last a couple of decades it just doesnt clean under the rim so use this in the bowl itself then break out the clorox wipes or get old school and do it really good with a rag i use both depending on how much i feel like it and whats available,-,very good,-,-,very good
this does the job and looks good,-,good,-,-,good
easy to assemble and i like the look of them they keep a “clean” appearance which is nice and they dry very fast so i dont have to leave them hanging on the edge of the toilet to do so forever however they just dont clean as well as a regular scrubbing type im using a lot of elbow grease to get off the toilet dingleberries so i probably wont buy the silicone kind again,-,-,-,-,-
works really well  cleans toilet nothing gets stuck in the brush,-,good,-,-,good
these get your toilet bowl cleaner off the floor out of the way and out of the dirty rusty decorative models  it has a holder that allows for air to circulate between the brush and holder so theres no odor and the bottom can be taken off for cleaning  its ingenious  the silicone brush is different so give it a chanceslightly smiling face,-,-,-,-,-

"thats a lot of garbage bags  i am probably set for awhile and i can dig it as garbage bags are one of those things that i always forget to buy until i am down to my last one

glad has been my bag of choice for a long long time  they are always strong and sturdy and the drawstring option is the best  i really appreciate that i can fill the big while its in the can and then when i take it out the forceflex option kicks in and creates more room so that i can easily tie it and toss it in the bin  these are kind of the standard level of strong for glad bags  good for just regular indoor trash  i dont recommend overfilling or putting the heaviest things in them  go for the next level of strength if thats your routine  the scent is rather light but very nice  you dont walk into a room and get overwhelmed by it but it also helps to mask up close if you did happen to throw something in that could get a little rank  when in use i think it lasts about a week and then will start to fade  i think its a good practice to take the trash out about every 4 days anyway so this works well  i did notice that even after more than a week in the outside bin missed a trash pickup week that when i went to throw another bag in after being shut the whole time i did still get just a very slight whiff of the lavendar and no yuck smells at all from the trash

my main reason for choosing glad now though is their sustainability story  they are making commitments to help support environmental concerns and make regular updates to their website around their progress  this is a commitment to our future that i can really get behind by choosing their products it enforces my commitment as well",-,very good,very good,-,very good
"note i ordered the lavender gain forceflex kitchen trash bags 13 gal
the bags are rolled up not connected to each other so you dont have to tear one bag off from the next all the bags are in one thick box and there is no perforation or preset opening to pull the bags through i just lifted one half of the glued lid and was able to fish the individual bags up that way

these smell pleasant not overpowering or too chemicalsmelling i prefer using lavender because its said that some bugs  critters are repelled by that scent

i did notice that when i put a bag in my 13gal trash can it is shorter than the generic stretchy bags i normally use hanging about 8 above the bottom of my trash can i imagine that when the bag is filled with trash it will stretch all the way down with the weight and not tear if thats not the case i will come back to update this review

i dont normally use expensive brand name trash bags since i dont want to spend my money on something designed to be thrown out anyway however this box of 110 bags a years supply for us is listed at a reasonable price of 22 at the time of my order which is a pretty decent value for this brand i cant give it a full 5 stars until after ive used them a few times to assess their strength and fit but out of the box so far they are a strong 4star product",very good,very good,very good,very good,very good

my home is clean,-,-,-,-,-
i used these pads with my swiffer mop they work well and they smell good they are pre moistened and you can see the bubbles from the solution they have bumps on them to grab the dirt i used them on my floors and my walls they are a very good brand,-,very good,-,-,very good
smells wonderful and a great price in comparison to other brands,very good,-,-,-,very good

i thought these bags would be thicker i use the bags to cover items on my patio unsatisfied but not unhappywinking face,-,poor,-,poor,poor
these are definitely heavier than what we typically used for trash bags but not as heavy duty as contractor grade ones my husband didnt think these would be heavy duty enough for him to use on carpentry projects but are great for trash etc the first one we took out of the box did have a hole in the side by the cinching part but the next one was fine im assuming this was a fluke,-,very good,-,very good,very good
these glad trash bags work really well theyre 30 gallons so theyre huge and they hold a lot theyre also really strong i can put a lot of large broken down cardboard boxes in just one of them i like to do that so i dont waste any bags or space i stuff them full they also have a drawstring so its easy to tie them up when theyre full im very happy with these trash bags,-,very good,-,very good,very good
"i have a tendency to overfill trash bags and it drives my husband crazy as hes usually the one dealing with them every time i clean out my closet i fill trash bags with my clothes and when he goes to bring them downstairs and to the car the ties break and the bags rip so to test these new bags i did my usual routine with mostly sweaters and sweatpants and the bag barely strained

aside from using them for donations well be using them in the garage and for outdoor stuff but not for leaves or anything light since i feel like that would be a waste im also hoping they make these same strength bags in a 13 gallon size so i can use them in my kitchen",-,very good,very good,-,very good
these are great sturdy thick black trash bags theyre pretty large bigger than my standard sized trash can and feel much more sturdy than regular bags ive already gone through a few and they held up the multifloor journey down to the trash can the only downside is that the drawstrings dont seem as sturdy as usual perhaps because this holds more? i typically dont hold my trash bags by the drawstring anyway so this didnt impact my rating but if securing the drawstrings and having them be useful is of need to you id probably go with something else a little disappointing given theyre advertised as being strong but the bag itself is,-,very good,-,-,very good
there is not my to say about the bags they are heavy duty glad bags these are labeled as the protection series which the description says that the bag is stretchy at the top but has a reinforced center to keep trash from tearing through overall the bags seem like any other heavy duty glad bag ive used in the past which is not really a bad thing because they always get the job done for me,-,very good,-,-,very good
"glad guaranteed strong large drawstring trash bags 30 gallon 70 count

using these for my large bin in the garage i put a lot of sorted things in the one including leftover cut woods and odd ends so far these bags have held up to these items and has not punctured
the opening is large enough to cover the large bin and the drawstrings help me get it closed the bag up nicely to be toss out
the liner is pretty thick and seems to be able to handle what i throw at it
i would recommend these large trash bags",-,very good,-,very good,very good

i bought these for some handheld cbs each cb takes 10 aa rechargeable or 8 alkaline batteries i have 7 cbs so i need 70 batteries  i was using duracell alkaline and they worked great but throwing out 70 batteries every week was crazy so i bought these these would not fit i pushed them into the cbs then i couldnt get the covers on so i tried taking them out oh no they were so big they were stuck i took all the screws out of the cb and tried to pry the battery compartments open enough to get them out and broke two of my expensive cbs not happy about that so these are useless to me i still want  rechargeable batteries and have contacted most of the other suppliers  turns out these are about the thinnest ones on the market i thought if i got a smaller mah they would be thinner like a 2400mah or a 2000mah even a 1100mah nope all are bigger than duracell alkaline duracell alkaline is 139 mm and these are 141 to 142mm in diameter  i even got an email from ansmann aa 2850 mah slimline version and they said theirs are 144   sad the makers have to try to make them so powerful that they are too big im not complaining about this company because they are all doing it but for my application these are useless,bad,bad,-,bad,bad

got about a week out of a charged set in cold weather in gamecam much longer in mild weather  will repurchase these when needed,-,poor,-,-,poor
ive used them in an insulin pump and use them in nearly all my aa and aaa applications no complaints understanding they arent as good as a normal alkaline and take a while to charge best to buy in big packs with a big charger so you can get them all going and have plenty to be ready that are charged when they end up in all the kids toys and removed when you need some ready to go,-,good,-,-,good
they seem to be working well and charging  i cant speak of longevity as we havent been using them very long yet,-,good,-,-,good

"great floor cleaner for pet accidents occasionally when my dogs have an accident in the house without hesitation i reach for this hard floor cleaner

after drying the floor i spray the hard floor cleaner around the area in need of cleaning as per the directions i let it sit and penetrate for a few minutes before using clean paper towels to dry off the floor

if the accident in question has been on the floor for an unclear amount of time i sometimes repeat the process to make sure i have gotten through the layers appropriately

the spray has a pleasant citrus scent and my dogs have not had repeat accidents in the same spots so i believe it does a great job of removing the invisible odor through its enzymatic formula",-,very good,very good,-,very good

"the product works as described  i gave it four stars because i need three sheets to clean my kitchen and dining room floor  granted it is oversized but would think one or two sheets would be plenty per cleaning but it gets dry before i am 1/3 finished  id rather use the spray and washable pad
would work great if my kitchen were smaller as the sheets are super convenient and easy to use  highly recommend for smaller area use",-,very good,-,-,very good

i dont nor will i ever use any product other than bona on any of my floor finishes and havent for 7 years i even use their wood cabinet cleaner in my kitchen these wet pads are good to use in a pinch for a quick small area  like one room most of the reviews were negative due to the fact that they dont fit the bona brand stick well leaving the middle not coming in contact with the floor thereby wasting money and the entire pad being useless i have my housekeeper use these on a small size not the large one swiffer floor stick and the edges are able to tuck in the 4 corners without coming loose or falling out since its a flat bottom the whole pad does come in contact with the floor and doesnt leave the center ‘up in the air so it wont clean i honestly prefer the large refill bottles and pour the cleaner in the smaller spray bottle using one for each type of cleaner i have been using the washable white microfiber pads with elastic around them which fit perfectly with the swiffer for the other bona cleaners however i always have a pack or two of these premoistened pads in my house and use them for a single room or a hallway until they get dry then they get tossed in the garbage while more expensive than the refill bottles they are good for reasons mentioned and i havent had any issues with them being too wet or too dry if you think theyre too wet then just go over the floor with a dry cloth or wait until it dries before walking on the floor ive not had problems with this leaving a residue or dull finish  since i buy items on amazon that are not familiar to me based on the honest and informative reviews of others if you find this one to be helpful please mark it as such for future reference thanks,very good,very good,-,very good,very good

"i wanted to give this product 5 stars but i am simply not sure if it is working fully personally i still get slime in all of my humidifiers so it is not preventing slime buildup i still have to clean them every week or so however the slime has gone from an orange color to a yellow/golden hue after adding this product so i am going to give them the benefit of the doubt that the solution is neutralizing the bacteria getting into the air

also their statement this one ounce bottle of humidifier demineralization solution will last about 100 days is a bit misleading you need to add 6 drops per gallon  i have 3 humidifiers totalling 5 1/2 gallons that i run 24/7 i have to refill them 23 a week i follow the instructions on amount to add and i am on my second bottle in 2 months

but as i said it seems to be neutralizing the bacteria due to the color change and im more concerned about it not getting in the air than cleaning it i may increase the amount to see if it gets rid of the slime altogether but if it does it means i will go through it even faster

overall i give this 4 stars more like 35  shipping was effortless and quick",-,very good,very good,very good,very good

"i purchased the “pumie” brand from our local grocery store and it was about 1300 i had never used this type of product to clean with and was skeptical that it was going to leave deep noticeable scratches in the porcelain i guess in my mind i thought these would be similar to the pumice stones that you would use on your feet its a much softer material and it will get the worst of stains out of your toilet or any porcelain surface i tried everything to get a toilet clean in a rental we have and nothing else came close i have been a huge fan of barkeepers friend  the powdered version for years now and even it wouldnt get out the buildup these are great for hard water stains and other unmentionable stains left by renters

its great to find these in a two pack that is less than the first one i purchased its softer and gets smaller with use so i am pleased with these as well i just wish they all had a slightly stronger handle this product has a longer handle but i had to hold it closer to the head of the pumice as i felt like it was going to break when i was scrubbing really hard  if i had not tried this type of cleaning method and received unbelievable results from this great idea i would have had to replace the toilet i have never seen anything as disgusting as the one in our rental property not even at the worst truck stop bathroom ive ever been into in my life

great idea and it makes for a much easier cleaning experience its best to have an extra one on hand as well as the first time i used a similar product i had to go get another one as they wear down to a point like shape and then its either use the last with your hands or just get a new one",-,very good,very good,-,very good
im telling you right now  if you have calcium buildup at the waterline in your toilet  forget the expensive chemicals and go straight to this product  i tried baking soda vinegar chemicals scrubbing etcnothing worked  i even tried coke  2 liters right down the drain ugh  i gave up thinking maybe i will just color the toilet water and hide the calcium line  i was burnt out on trying to get this problem resolved  then i finally ordered this product  four minutes per toilet and in 12 minutes they were looking brand new no scratches no calcium build up  do the least expensive option first  little effort product was sturdy enough dont overpower the handle  problem solved,bad,bad,-,-,bad
wow this really works after asking chatgpt for help i bought a recommended pumice stone there was a toilet bowl ring that seemed to be etched into the bowl years of trying to get it out with other regular cleaning products wouldnt work this pumice stone on a stick really did the trick not a trace left like new toilet bowl also worked on a stubborn stain in the bathtub of course it took almost 3/4ths of the pumice to get it out and when it was getting short it slid off the stick from all the friction i still have the 2nd stick left for whenever i might need it,-,good,-,-,good
we have insanely hard water in the house we just bought i can clean the toilets twice a week and still get a copper colored line around the bowl this thing is awesome for getting it clean it takes no time at all the handle helps keep you out of the yuck and its easy to clean under the ledge to keep all your water holes flowing nicely the only thing is that i hate how the handle goes up into the stone like a popsicle stick once you wear down the stone enough it becomes hard to use because of the plastic sticking out of the center,-,very good,very good,-,very good

i was on the hunt for some affordable replacement quality head mops for my oh cedar spin mop bucket so when i came onto amazon i read a lot of reviews on this one in particular by this brand stood out to me because it had good reviews when i received the product it was vacuum sealed and i began to get to work im surprised at how good the quality is they are a exact dupe as the original ocedar replacement had mops overall great quality and great buy and the price even better,very good,very good,-,-,very good
these mop heads are great i would recommend washing them before using them just because of how fluffy they are i found that if i washed it before i used it for the first time not so much bulky stolid would stick yo it and not come off so something to be aware of but over all it was cheaper buying these here than at the store and they work great for cleaning my clients homes,very good,very good,very good,-,very good
these go on with ease they are very poofy so i would recommend washing before use other than that as described and works great especially for price,very good,very good,-,-,very good
like that the size is much bigger than the original mop head that came with my o ceder spin mop,-,-,-,-,-
its always good to have extra mop head replacements on hand these fit my previously purchased broom nicely the new mop head replacement went on effortlessly and works very well,-,very good,-,-,very good
these work just as good as the original ones just make sure you click them in all the way,-,very good,-,-,very good

this easy to use simple cleaning tool is so great i have two dogs so the hair is a battle i knew the vacuum wasnt reaching under the stove or fridge so when i saw the video for this product i figured i would give it a try wow it grabbed so much dirt and hair with one swipe this is what everyone in my family is getting for christmas,-,very good,-,-,very good
i had to laugh at myself for feeling so satisfied after using this product to clean  couldnt believe the dust and dog hair that was under my sofa where the swifter couldnt get to  i was also able to get under my fridge oven and washer dryer  great product for cleaning under items on hard surfaces,-,-,-,-,-
easily reached under my stove refrigerator  washer in addition to sofas i was please  also after found it useful in cleaning the top of my refrigerator and air returns that are high i love that this order included three reusable sleeves that wash nicely,-,very good,-,-,very good
i had another duster for under the fridge but it was too thick  this one is perfect fits under my fridge washer dryer and wire shelving  has removable washable covers  its the best,-,-,-,very good,very good

the only thing not making it 5 stars is that it is so flexible that doesnt work for everything but that is a bonus on other areas",-,very good,-,-,very good
"nothing to dislike im thrilled i ordered this one i have had golden retrievers and now a golden doodle omg the hair and dust under my w/d and refrigerator the item is flat enough to get under appliances it came with 3  ill call them socks  the device that is sor the “ socks “ is extendable awsum the socks fit nicely and dont slip off a great find
i can use it for other cleaning  like the dust on my fans thumbs up and my wide window coverings
im very happy with this reasonably priced product",very good,very good,-,very good,very good
the item has made it so much easier to clean under my bed couches and so much morebest purchase ever highly recommend,-,-,-,-,-
i bought this because it has a telescoping handle  great product  so easy to use and better quality than i expected,-,very good,-,-,very good
"this product works very well overall  these dusters are great if you dust regularly or are only picking up loose dust  they dont work so well if youre trying to clean in the kitchen or restroom where oil or moisture has caused the dust to get stuck onto the surface but i cant blame the product for not working in those situations

the reason im giving this product only 4 stars is because of the packaging it arrives in  the handle comes folded up with the three dusting pads all sealed together in a small clear plastic bag  the only thing on the bag is a small white label that describes the contents swiffer dust cleaner set 1 handle and 3 replacement pads  the packaging really makes me question whether this is a legitimate swiffer product or a knockoff

overall the product works fine but i dislike that it feels like a knockoff",-,very good,-,very good,very good
i gently rinse them when they are dusty picks dirt up good wet too,-,good,-,-,good
i really like these products my only gripe is that i wish they came with moreand i know i could have gotten more but am i the only one that notices theyre a liiitttleee more expensive then expected? oh well besides that they work so well i used to use these at an old job where i swiffered a whole room and they work wonderfully in my house they do collect dust obviously the more dusty a place islike super dusty hasnt been dusted in years youll have to change out the swifter more often but if youre a regular swiffer then you could use 1 of the swiffers a few times so thats nice they can collect a lot of dust too theyre so easy to use too and yes i recommend the heck out of these cause i dont feel the need to wipe down dusty areas with a towel before i wipe them down again you know swiffer just takes care of it so yay,very good,very good,very good,-,very good
it makes dusting easier and i am all for that  good product,-,very good,-,-,very good
they clean really nice better than the old feather duster no complaints here,-,-,-,-,-
easy to use and picks up dust wonderfully,-,very good,-,-,very good
ive used the swiffer dust cleaners for years probably since they first came out  i always find them easy to use  just insert the handle into the little plastic frame then insert the frame into the wiper cloth and youre set to go  easy peasy,-,very good,-,-,very good

i love these little things i have them throughout my house in dark areas to attract mosquitoes away from the bedrooms and living room within the first 30 minutes of use it already killed one mosquito that was flying around great product to have around the summer when mosquitoes are at the highest in my area with all the rain thats been on and off i have noticed that mosquitoes are coming out a little earlier than the summer these are going to help and make a huge difference in my house,-,very good,-,-,very good
these work great but understand what it is a bug zapper they draw in gnats with the light so use them at night easy to clean looks like a night light  no noise i cant imagine it working on bigger bugs but great on fruit flys and gnats hopefully these last a while they seem sturdy dont expect daylight attraction,-,very good,-,-,very good
every since i put these up  i barely see lil mosquitoes  or whatever they are called lol flying around these are the results after 1 week just only from 2 bathrooms love them,-,very good,-,-,very good
seems to work its not fly season yet i liked that it came with 2 of them i didnt realize it was going to come with 2 its killed a couple of fruit flys but thats about it right now maybe in summer it when its fly season we will find out the true effects of it  i gave it 4 stars because we dont know if it will work on flys or mosquitoes yet,-,good,-,-,good
no doubt it works extremely well and catches lots of annoying critters also it is easy to cleangrinning face with big eyes my problem is that it is smaller than a pack of cigarettes and is priced way too high for such a little zapper,poor,poor,-,-,poor
i purchased this item because i havr an infestation of little flies in my kitchen and bathroom  i have no idea where they are coming from  this item certainly catches these critters,-,-,-,-,-
i live in florida and around this time of year the mosquitos are rampant every time i open my door a few come inside  normally when i find lizards water bugs etc in my home i rescue them with a glass jar and a piece of cardboard and let them outside  but mosquitos are just impossible to catch plus they carry diseases like west nile plus they are just eating me alive  so something had to be donethis seemed like the least cruel way to do the job  i just installed them today and have already killed one mosquito  i believe they die instantly  much better than fly tape which in my opinion is just brutally cruel,-,-,very good,-,very good

the best part was the delivery the guy brought it in a big brown bag after i opened the bag its useful was through i then placed the big brown bag in the trash bin and at some point the local garbage dept took it i didnt physically see it but im presuming i dont know where but its no longer here therefore it has to be somewhere else

these tissues are great for blowing you nose do not use it as a tp but if you do youre going to need a paper towel different product review to clean your hands after that please wash your hand before you blow your nose because then youll need a cologne or perfume or a breath mint to get rid of the scent and taste

this is so far the best squeegee i have owned  good weight not heavy but a solid weight not plastic two hook/hanger options and the blade is comparable to a wiper blade on your car  one pass on my shower glass wipes water away without streaks or missed spots  my old squeegee required me to overlap half of the length with each pass and still left streaks  this squeegee is big enough and works well enough that i literally only need a total of 3 passes to do my entire door  great time saver  and the same with my shower walls  mine is a fiberglass shower wish it were real tile and my old squeegees would skip over the small grooves meant to mimic tile grout lines  this squeegee gets right into those grooves without any additional effort so even the shower walls are wiped clean with only a single pass per every 10 inches/the width of the squeegee  i imagine that if it works that well on my shower it probably will work just as well on the other surfaces it advertises/suggests  i just dont have the need to try other surfaces since i got this for my shower  all in all i have nothing negative to say about this squeegee except why i didnt find it sooner  5 stars all the way,-,very good,very good,-,very good
"glass shower doors are great  but if you dont dry them they tend to etch over time and they physically cant be cleaned back to crystal clear  a squeegee is a good way to extend the life of these assets and this one is better than many that ive used

first i got the wide 12 version and its pretty wide i would have been good with 10  i am having very good success with it really getting the water off of the flat glass surfaces  tiles always more temperamental but thats working okay as well
it comes with the two hooks one that lets you hang it from the flat surface the other from the hook in the handle  ive used the hook for the handle and will be using the other twohook hook for a razor  these are adhesive backed and they are sticking very well to my tile  just be sure your tile is bone dry first and its not going to doink off like suction cups eventually seem to do
as for the material its inexpensive and light weight but certainly no worse than what i would expect for something at this price point  i dont have a problem with it  all in all as expected and with the utility of the hooks even a little better",very good,very good,very good,-,very good
"this kind of a squeegee is a musthave in every bathroom that have glass doors even though it can be used in cleaning windows glass car glass and many other flat surfaces around the house but would not use it on anything other than glass

this squeegee particularly is very well made of stainless steel and a good quality silicone it is light weight and feels durable it cleaned my bathrooms glass door perfectly without leaving streaks including a second hook is a bonus and gives another option of how to hang the squeegee on the wall the adhesive hook seems sturdy and strong i didnt remove the hook from the wall so i dont know if it is going to be easy to remove or no time will tell",-,very good,very good,-,very good
i like that this is a good squeegee at a reasonable price it comes with two different hooks seems well made and durable however i am not sure how long the adhesive will hold for use in the shower i am used to suction cups also if you are expecting a small footprint this thing is wide and it is not the flexible type that can fold up when not in use like the simple human one i currently use albeit it more expensive overall it does the job,very good,very good,-,-,very good
"i ordered the 12 inch version in matte black  i really like the longer squeegee in the shower as you can clean the glass quickly with less swipes of it  this one does a nice job of removing the water from the glass and tile in my shower so that my shower stays cleaner longer  it takes all the water off and does not squeak on the glass when you use it and does seem like it will last a long time

its pretty heavy duty and well built  i like the design of it and the way it feels in my hand and looks in my shower  it comes with two different hooks to hang it  i did not use either one as they only attach with the included double sided tape  im not a fan of sticking something like that to my tile or glass so i just set it on my shower bench when done

i do like the matte black but am a little concerned that i wont be able to see any mold or other build up on it due to the color but so far thats not a problem

overall i recommend it",-,very good,very good,very good,very good
"first and foremost this is a squeegee  it really has 2 jobs  wipe water off surfaces and hang on the hook looking good  right?

the size is good at 10 inches  that width means less swipes over a surface to get the moisture off of it  it is comfortable in the hand and lightweight  bottom line  it works

there are 2 different hooks to hang the squeegee on  either a single hook that goes into the handle of the squeegee or a 2 hook variety that allows you to hang it by the blade end  for me the double hook is my choice although both appear to work well  its your choice

the color is a soft stainless/silver look  it is not a brilliant chrome but it isnt a true brushed stainless finish either  if you are not looking for a soft stainless look you will likely be disappointed with this

but if you are looking for a squeegee that does the job and the choice of finish meets your expectation i would suggest that you give this a try",-,poor,-,-,poor
this is actually a pretty nicely made squeegee its a nice size at around 10 inches across and the squeegee part is nice and firm allowing for consistent smooth water removal it also comes with a couple of ways you can attach it to the wall  a hook so you can hang it by the bottom part of the handle and one where you can hang it by the neck i chose to use the neck hanger and it attached very easily to the shower wall it doesnt seem like its going anywhere anytime soon the bronze finish makes it looks nice and matches well with the hardware i have in my bathroom solid purchase,-,very good,very good,-,very good
it definitely makes your bathroom smell great but it doesnt keep your toilet clean  finding the right spot on the bowl to have the water wash over it creates a problem when the water flow isnt strong serves its purpose of having a nice scent in the bathroom,-,very good,-,-,very good

as a person who uses these in my dorm and house this is now a staple although many people do not really like the scent i dont think its bad and it does the job for my dorm of 6 it lasts about half a month to 1 month before we change it for the price it doesnt seem too bad for me since it does keep the toilet relatively cleaner for longer,very good,very good,-,-,very good

"i ordered and received this 3pack of jumbo rolls of 365 branded paper towels the 365 brand is from whole foods market and these paper towels are 100 recycled with 135sheets per roll

these paper towels offer solid absorbency and are reasonably soft i wouldnt call them a premium paper towel and im not sure id use them on super fragile surfaces i doubt that they would scratch but i just dont find them soft enough that i want to use them on glass or on my own glasses i dont use them on monitors but i wouldnt hesitate to use them on hard surfaces like my desk walls and my pretty standard countertops these have good absorbency and are nicely priced for a 100 recycled product i would definitely order them again and plan to do so they are available via amazon fresh another plus since i can have them delivered with my grocery order

overall i wouldnt call these a 5star paper towel but they are very solidly 4star and that suits most of my household needs so ill definitely be adding these to my regular household rotation for cleaning and homecare",very good,very good,-,-,very good
these are pretty good especially when i compare them to the paper towels that i normally get locally that are close in comparison by type like the amount size and ply they dont leave a bunch of fuzz on my paper towel holder like others ive used so thats a plus thumbs up they work for my needs and i would buy them again,-,very good,-,-,very good

i am tired of every manufacturer using plastic bottles what about the environment? this eco box makes sense i like a subtle fragrance which dreft has the first use should be over a sink or on the washer as you cant gauge how much comes out until youve tried it and you dot want to spill on something not easily washed,-,poor,-,poor,poor

ive been told that i may be allergic to formaldehyderelated chemicals used to produce some storebought products so i am trying to find a hypoallergenic tissue that i like and can afford to continue using this one is  a better price and softer and more absorbant than others ive tried but definitely not as soft as the brand i was using before i discovered my sensitivity i wish the tissue was soft on both sides but ive discovered that if i hang the roll with the sheets coming from the bottom i can dispense with the softer side on top i was always a rollfromthetop person  so this is an adjustment  but i can live with that if my symptoms can be kept in check,very good,very good,-,very good,very good
we got used to the thickness of another brand but the cost has become impossible since ive been buying tp by the case i decided to go with caboo and found that just 2 more squares beyond the 4 we used of the thicker brand and its a great replacement we dont have to replace the roll as often and its more affordable to begin with cant beat that,very good,very good,very good,-,very good

the density of the sponges is too low that water runs right through them so they didnt do much of the absorbent job but other than that they work okay for other purposes just if you want a good absorbent sponge then its a no no they absorb and hold less water than a piece of paper towel,-,neutral,-,-,neutral
"i was pleasantly surprised at the quality of these pipe cleaners
not just for the price but not even taking that into consideration
they are sturdy correctly sized and the bristles seem to be just stiff enough to clean well
i have used them on everything from higher priced brier to corn cob to wood pipes and it cleans them all
great product from an american company in florida
i will always keep a couple of bags around",very good,very good,-,-,very good
"for the money these pipe cleaners are great  ive used them several times now and they are very absorbent and stiff enough to go through tight places while still being flexible enough to go around those curves you get in full bent or even half bent pipes
overall excellent product  i will certainly order again when these run out",very good,very good,very good,-,very good
i buy the short 6” pipe cleaners to clean out the thin plastic inner cannula of my trach they have to be sturdy enough to push through the thick gunky mucus that clogs up in there yet they have to be soft enough to not poke holes in it while doing so  i bought this lova brand when my usual sub  save name brand became unavailable one month so glad i did  i get more cleaners for less money and they work a little better  i use 4 at a time and my old ones tend to catch on the tip end of the wire and try to snag in the plastic these dont do that as bad this means less having to completely replace the cannula due to a puncture while cleaning my insurance has cut back in how many cannulas they send me now so this is a huge game changer  will be buying this lova brand with a monthly sub  save from now on  thank you,very good,very good,very good,-,very good
if you want to clean a pipe or a small tube or just do some arts and crafts these pipe cleaners are perfect they are exactly what they say they are and are a good value for the amount you get in one package,very good,very good,-,very good,very good

"update 61715  the best just got better eneloops can hold up to 70 after 10 years as indicated on their official website its unclear if fully charged eneloops can hold up to 70 after 10 years or the latest set of eneloops are able to hold up to 70 after 10 years it would be impressive if this were true but after 10 years i think the cycle number would greatly be reduced as testing showed less cycle usage on older cells still nimh technology can be impressive as i have 16 year old cells that work in a clock for a couple of months itll be interesting how an aged eneloop would function

update 110414  be aware of the chinese knockoffs of eneloops they are nowhere near as good as the japanese ones the chinese eneloops die around 500 cycles while the japanese ones continue running over 800 cycles try to get the japanese eneloops if you can as they are generally more reliable hopefully amazon will continue to carry the japanese ones

update 92714  did a battery test of the pack i used and the battery that was fully discharged still managed to produce the necessary mah and was slightly higher than the others for some reason or another only 2 batteries was slightly higher maximum of 39mah difference capacity so its unclear as to the reason behind that though 2 of the batteries were numbered and were discharging for a bit in a tv remote and then in a flashlight so it appears that the more often you use them the more mah they will produce that seems to be the case with any nimh battery its best to use them versus leaving them in storage for a long time so it is highly recommended you buy what you need if you need some extras or in case make sure you cycle them through and not just leave them sit in storage for several years without using them since basic eneloop batteries have high recharging cycles its better to discharge them fully a few times to break the battery in and use them a few times in a high drain device to keep them working they dont have to be drained fully 40 discharged thats 40 charge left in the battery is the best which will help keep the mah up and fully discharging them every once in a while to prevent overcharging and voltage depression or memory effect which nimhs are highly resistant that or even dont even have that problem such as the company has stated they mostly are susceptible to overcharging though which does cause the voltage depression phenomenon which acts like there is a memory effect

regular cheap nimhs or just cheap nimhs in general lose their mah capacity over time and even when they are just being used avoid those types eneloops appear to be the best amazonbasics duracell and most energizers are good alternatives if eneloops are not available but avoid most cheap chargers and find a smart charger with negative delta v overheat protection and capable of charging any number of batteries the panasonic sounds like a pretty good cheap alternative and get the ones with the batteries as they are a better deal i plan on getting some eneloops pro that comes with one of these chargers but with the basic 2100 cycle eneloops its probably not needed to have the higher capacity ones but they do last a bit longer on a single charge for critical usage i cant wait to see how long these batteries will hold up during the test of time using rechargeable duracells they hold their charge for a very long time almost 10 years in service and only has a loss of mah capacity but they still perform for a pretty long time can still be a few months sitting idle while the energizers i got around the same time the 2500mah ones lose their charge within a few weeks but can be recharged and then sit for awhile on the charger and they will get a bit more charge out of them but those will primarily be used in tv remotes and other really low drain devices where i dont mind recharging them every few weeks anyway the eneloops perform well and seem to have a long life ahead of them



i got the 16 pack and also heard that these batteries are similar to the amazonbasics which claims they do not lose capacity when over discharged while i am still in the process of finding out whether the battery that i subjected to an over discharge has lost mah capacity it held its ground from zero volts with the battery fully discharged or near death i threw it in a remote with a charged eneloop and it was showing a sharp decrease from 09 volts to 04 volts then the battery stabilized itself there with no decline or any indication that there was cell reversal which charges the battery in reverse i wasnt sure what to make of that but i have concluded that there is indeed some over discharge protection i decided to put more strain on the battery and threw the batteries in a flashlight to my amaze the flashlight dim as ever was able to light up i let the batteries sit in there 15 minutes to see if the light would stop working but even after 15 minutes the light was still going i took the battery out and it was registering just under 01 volt while i was being distracted that i didnt have enough time to unscrew the flashlight to get to the battery i threw the the batteries back in the flashlight and checked it again after 5 minutes it was still showing just under 01 volt no reverse voltage

it appears that after my test these batteries do not reverse charge and is somewhat resistant to over discharging which would be fine mixing a pack of these batteries in different devices even after my tests i wouldnt recommend mixing the batteries as i am sure even once these batteries reaches 07 volts they start eating up cycles i have no idea whether keeping the batteries in a discharged state and using them would start reducing the life of the battery or that they would take up a few cycles but i still need to test the mah of the batteries to see whether the one i over discharged has lost capacity which is the other claim from amazonbasics and i think eneloop advertises the same thing it would also make sense why the amazonbasics has lesser rated recharge cycles then eneloops eneloops do not advertize they can handle over discharging and it makes sense why they dont want to they want to make sure the consumer gets the most recharges out of their batteries which would make these batteries the number 1 rechargeable battery company of all time

which is why i highly recommend these batteries these batteries will last a very long time if you take care of them you probably will never need to buy new batteries as if you were to charge these batteries daily or discharge them daily you would still get about 6 years out of them which is hard to come by with rechargeables that are constantly being discharged and recharged with minimal rest im going to give these batteries another test which will only be 2 aa in 100130f heat i have had some people say they dont want to switch to rechargeables because they think that heat will ruin the batteries i beg to differ while the batteries might not last as long with this other test these batteries should have no problem being able to work in the heat and while it might reduce these batteries life to about 24 years its far better than replacing the batteries weekly spending more money than what you would on rechargeables

on a fresh charge opened from the package while it was difficult to understand the date code of the batteries 1405lj and 140400 i assume the 14 means the year which would mean these batteries were produced earlier in the year but again its not easy to tell based on the letters if anyone knows that information leave a comment back to a fresh charge from the opened package literally i am a bit disappointed from amazon sending me a product that has been opened its possible that it opened during shipping but i did get 2 different date codes on the batteries but it also appears that panasonic shipped them this way too i will say that panasonics packaging is left to be desired they could have packaged the 16 pack in a more secure packaging or give consumers a plastic container with the batteries in them but im not complaining eventually i will put them in a more secure container but for now the package is holding with some tape

on a fresh charge these batteries were able to give my phone a 92 charge using a usb charger powered by aa or aaa batteries provided that if i never did charge the batteries i wouldnt have gotten the 92 charge but after recharging the 4 set of batteries i used already i will see how much of a charge the batteries will put into after a full discharge i have noticed a few complaints about the batteries not being fully charged and while there are a few different reasons why there is a rare chance that you would get a set of batteries that are discharged or will not recharge correctly it is a fact of life and happens with any kind of product out there on the market when they are massed produced its also rare that businesses would actually strive to lower that percentage because anything with a 1 defect rate is acceptable loss limits when dealing with a world that strives to have profit over making that 1 happy though many companies do have exchange policies if you received a defective product

a couple of things to think about these are 12 volt batteries and while most devices that require 4 batteries will function fine with 4 nimh batteries any higher than that and you would start to see a declining performance or even if your product will function with 6 12 volt batteries versus the 15 volts the other thing to consider though with that is alkaline batteries are about 50 charged at 12 volts so these devices might run fine even with 11 volts but that really depends on the device recently i have found that some devices can ask for more than 12 volts and can be considering the nimh batteries as dying or low but it greatly depends whether the device is detecting the voltage or the ma being produced with that being said before assuming that these batteries do not come charged consider these things first that the device may ask for more voltage your charger is a cheap model or does not function properly batteries only carry 50 of rated capacity from the manufacture which a refresh is in need or that you require more than 4 batteries and the device will not function properly under the 12 volt batteries

with that being said before you assume these batteries are at fault try it in a different device or in a flashlight that only requires 13aa first after refreshing them a few times and see how they work with the initial use i managed to charge my phone up to 92 it was lower than the http//wwwamazoncom/duracellrechargeablebatteriesduralocktechnology/dp/b00dsyfaeq which managed to charge a few devices without being depleted those are rated at 2400mah still on first use these 2000mah hold up really well and are ideal in just about anything while there are some devices that wont work well with 12 volt batteries and its not a good idea to use rechargeables in smoke/carbon dioxide detectors or anything really vital to your safety i recommend using http//wwwamazoncom/duracellalkalinebatteriespreservetechnology/dp/b00edk4hxy for high drain devices that often need replacing for the smoke/carbon dioxide detectors the classic duracell battery also rated to last 10 years will work just fine

other than that these batteries hold up really well and i will post back when i got more info on the set of 4 batteries i have been testing with and will soon test another set out in my 2d maglite using d spacers of course to see how long they hold up for",very good,very good,very good,very good,very good
"i have lots of eneloop batteries for headphones portable fans etc  i select various products specifically if they are able to be used with aa or aaa batteries  i rotate my batteries so that im always using batteries that were charged a month or 5 months previously

these batteries do exactly what i expect them to do  however you need to treat them correctly  i have a smartcharger a 10year old la crosse unit that allows me to discharge batteries refresh whatever  i always charge my batteries at 200 mah speed  you do not want to quickcharge a battery  if you do not get a fancy charger then your batteries will not last you as long as my batteries do  you are also guaranteed not to get as full of a charge on each battery  in other words a cheapiecharger usually charges batteries in a pair  it may bring 1 battery up to 2200 of mah use and the other one might be 1800 or less

sometimes i am using a set of batteries in a scale or fan and 1 battery will be more drained than the others  if you charge 2 batteries in an inexpensive charger it will stop charging when one battery is full in a manner of speaking  this means that 1 battery will usually not get as full of a charge as possible  it is very important that each battery can be charged separately

batteries do get memories in them  every time i charge a battery i set my charger to discharge then it charges the battery after it drains it down to almost zero  sometimes after a year or more of use the aa batteries will only hold a charge of 1600 or so and i turn my unit to dischargerefresh  it runs for about 24 hours and then the battery has higher capacity again over 2000 and im happy  i have had eneloops for 10 years and ive never thrown any in the trash  im sure ive lost some though

even if you do get a fancy charger they cost 40 or 55 bucks you still will need to have a cheapie charger because sometimes my eneloops get down to absolute zero and my fancy charger cannot recognize any battery at all  i have to use my cheapiecharger to get at least a small charge into a dead battery  then my lacrosse unit will charge or refresh my battery again

long story short if you dont have patience and interest in prolonging your eneloop batteries they will not last for a lot of years like mine do  i am strongly against wasting money and also adding bad things to the landfill  if you are not serious about your batteries buy these and then buy more in 2 or 4 years when they do not hold as much of a charge as they did when they were new",poor,poor,poor,-,poor

"i have 8 ceiling fans in my house and have always put off cleaning them because it is such a pain i have to drag around a step stool or ladder carrying it up and down the stairs plus id always end up with the dirt and dust all over me in my hair eyes mouth  just everywhere including all over furniture and the floor and then id have to clean up all that mess

so i purchased 2 of these thinking id be able to clean all 8 fans at once without down time for cleaning the heads it didnt quite work out that way  i only got 4 of the fans cleaned before i needed to clean the heads of both dusters after unscrewing the handle where it attaches to the section containing the heads i carried these sections to the kitchen sink wet each one separately squirted on some dish detergent and worked up a lather amongst the fiber squeezing and scrubbing the heads with my hands after a thorough rinsing i hung them over the sink to dry the heads retained a lot of water so every 3060 minutes i returned to them and wrung them out by hand again figured theyd finally dry overnight but nothey were still quite damp in the morning and still not fully dry by the next day but they finally dried and i reattached them to the rest of the handles and fluffed up the heads as recommended to restore the static charge the 1st photo shows them after the washing drying and fluffing they look absolutely brand new

i had sprayed the fibers with endust before using and a small amount of dust from the blades did escape the fibers and land on the floor way less than my old dustcloth cleanings would dislodge thougn ive since read that i shouldnt have used any dusting products with these so maybe thats why  maybe the endust interfered with the electrostatic forces regardless it was my fault because it had been a couple of years since 3 of the fans had been cleaned so there was a lot of dust on the blades and now that i have these babies it will never be more than a few months between fan blade cleaning again and unlike other ceiling fan dusters these heads are plump and wide and full of fibers and hold a lot of dirt and dust

my only complaint about these is that it would be so much easier to clean the heads if the heads were removable from the metal especially if they could be washed in the washing machine note my reading of the listing lead me to believe that the heads were fully removeable for easy cleaning see 2nd pic and that is definitely not the case  they are permanently attached to the base of the duster even so cleaning the heads isnt all that difficult im just saying it could be even easier

and for full disclosure my hand/arm strength isnt enough to fully tighten all the handle joints so 1 or more of them unscrew a tiny bit with use but not enough to interfere with the dusters function and i just retighten the offending connection as best i can and carry on someone who has stronger hands and forearms wont have a problem at all

this is amazing  i have a very old one with bristles and a short handle so it was always a mess cleaning the ceiling fans but this is so much better  first the extended handle makes it more versatile and easier to use i can clean dust in the corners of the ceiling or tops of picture frames and door casings second it holds onto the dust better when you rub it to create a static charge lastly as good as it is at picking up dust its just as easy to shake it off and get it clean plus you can wash it hand wash but still better than no wash my other has dust that probably dates back to the civil war  i dont “gush” and i rarely write reviews i just do the star thing so i hope that this conveys how pleased i am with this product,-,very good,-,very good,very good

my wife is addicted to laundry thanks to oxiclean and downy scent boosters if shes smiling and enjoying a hectic chore for 5 people then i want her to stay happy she says shes addicted to it lol shes always getting my stains out from my work socks and my sons football socks she has the different variations of oxiclean and plays with them depending what shes washing it smells fresh feels great and looks awesome shes kept up with laundry since investing in better laundry products for several months now and says she gets so bored when she runs out of things to wash mind you our house flooded last year the house isnt complete but when shes doing laundry with the new open floor plan and washer under the stair case where she wanted it facing the kitchen to not have a laundry room but instead grant space to build a room for our daughter shes brilliant with the decisions of which walls got moved according to load bearing walls strapped with steel ties too btw my new stair case and us staying in the 1/2 story upstairs for now and yes thats a hassle but we make it work and have what is necessary we need floors and trim everywhere downstairs and so far shes gone desperate with our figh  with the mortgage company to release our insurance funds that i laid a plywood subfloor in the bathroom so far and she covered it with papermachete using paper bags aka kraft paper shes adding stain and clear coat now to create the moisture barier we need to protect the subfloor and old school sub floor wood below it from mold which weve treated to countless times and hey guys the paper bag trick is working and looks great so since we cant afford flooring for the whole house plus all the trim and cabinets vanities fixtures etc plus appliances if she can save thousands im willing to let her try a different technique she asked me if id let her at least try and if its messed up theres no harm done wed be using what we already have she wishes to do the wooden plank look painting strips measured and cut from kraft paper and stained with a wood tool to give it streaks and knots i am skeptical but optimistic if that makes sense shes disabled after a bad accident and i see her trying hard she just hates dishes so someday when we have a kitchen again not just a tiny kitchenette upstairs im getting her a dish washer i hope she can fall in love with like her washer which she has painted and decorated since the flood it floated and after it was power washer and electronics tweaked it works like a charm and its one of the pieces left from our life before back to back tragedies causing trauma for us and the kids but on day at a time never though wed all live in a finished attic and have a kitchenette her study area plus the extension over the kitchen where the new and spacious 2nd bathroom will go someday she wants to paper bag plank the stair case but idk as far as convenience being the only way up and down from living quarters with the den and also bedroom half the length of the house and yes everyon has their own bed and climate control where we sleep still room plentiful to walk around plus a dresser book shelf tv table old school antique her mom gave her and she saved the kids massive toy bin recliner and the 60” tv we literally got the week before harvey struck and caused the historic flooding here with my wife depressed i did let he rearrange some walls since it was all reinforced then raised and relevel and she was right without even being into construction and is doing 4 different color bling glitter walls for our daughters room and i two tones the boys room with blue left over from painting the bedroom we built together up stairs thats been our saving grace or wed be homeless still paying mortgage fema didnt bother to help using an excuse that we have flood insurance not understanding the mortgage company wont release those funds while over a year has passed the know are home and with sheetrock new insulation new support added a complete remodel after having to gut the entire house out i realized my wife had a back up plan all along and used her studio building we almost lost in the flood power washed it and she started clearing out upstairs and some storage space we borrowed to move everything into what was her business studio doing what was best for us as a family when that building meant hope and has meaning after her tragic deer car wreck that left her permanently disabled and in non stop pain she smiles when shes doing laundry and loves to soak things and it smells of a beautiful aroma i cant describe pants and shirts with stains theyd had for years are stain free i mean this stuff works miracles and she makes carpet cleaner concrete and grout cleaner and upholstery cleaner and much more the versatile is her favorite but she loves the vivid white and the odor blast powder and the liquid she loves the power oxiclean arm  hammer laundry detergent and is slowly phasing out the pods and mixing powdered soaps she calls super soap and boy to they sud up with bubbles nicely and smell breathtaking when done she likes to be artistic too shes also a musician and loving mother a jack of all trades but im proud of her bathroom floor technique shes been studying and working on i can respect that and hey we all 5 have clean linens pillows cases throw and fleece blankets comforters towels and all of our clothes nice clean and fresh and she folds everything straight out of the dryer and keeps wrinkles away and lent plus static electricity with using balled up aluminum foil in the dryer which actually really works guys its gotten my wife out of a rut and into something she feels confident and passionate about knowing its for her family and we seem to be everything to her we almost lost her in that brutal crash but she beat odds and made it when i get home from work and walk in im hit immediately with the fresh laundry fragrance of flowers and just cleanliness which is so rich its like a natural deodorizer just doing laundry where we relocated it it was a genius plan utilizing under stair case space for the washer and dryer her designs on the are coming along and maybe its a decorative color splash for whatever colors shes got going on in her imaginary envisionment of what the end product will be if the bathroom floor goes well shell do upstairs new bathroom and ill finish laying subfloor everywhere except bedrooms which we hope and pray for carpet found what she loved and in a few months we can afford that but for now i may help her cut and paint the paper planks evenly and install them through the living dining kitchen base of stair well hall way and living room closet using this pattern if its a success cause we can change it out later but will give such a more warm and welcoming appearance looking more like a home not a construction site she cant do a lot but shes done more than she knows to help i work and was doing laundry dishes cleaning bathing kids and everything while she fell deep into depression surrounded by nowhere to sit just piles or clean but wrinkled laundry  too overwhelming to even look at she shut it out when after displacement staying at church housing last minute  we were forced home or  be homeless but  to my surprise she had cleared out upstairs trim things we tossed up to the second floor in attempt to save from the flood thankfully little over 6 feet or gushing river current they destroyed everything in the path including all appliances except the deep freezer stove which fit into the trailer we used temporarily the washer and 2 dryers and 2 refriderators with most our furnitur except mattresses and just one drawer set we are thankful for and saved the dining table and a love seat love couch is in the den area we all fit and have our own space up here so its not that bad we need closer doors rods rod holders and shelves built to store everything nowhere to put anything like literally and the studio is packed and then a shelf site beside the washer piles with cleaning products and she is thrilled for subscriptions chose to benefit us on her time from where shed need a refill or something she knows the financial situation and used items we already had for that im proud of but shes upset she physically cant work and everything we had we owned and earned and maintained together and now shes afraid the house could end up complete with her interior design talent tricks and hacks to dress everything seasonally but not now shes just wanting her floors and the donated dryer which is old but in great shape and the washer i saved she is attached to she likes to soak items for multiple hours before washing or if really dirty she will add everything in water with laundry then hand wash pushing it up and down to mix it then she adds everything again and lets it stand then lets it run through a cycle with only one rinse unless its a larger load she messes with it here and there as it soaks smiling the whole time and breathing deeply the aroma which from hitting the front door to walk in im hit with a relaxing aroma of her laundry which i know she utilized the space connections and the sheetrock around was painted by her shes painted more than half so far and i come in and do what i can with ceilings cause due to her spinal surgery from breaking 18 vertebra she cant look straight up and ends up in tons of pain trying but she does try she has intense ideas but oddly enough theyre intensive she promised to locate some antique furniture thats used either in good condition or poor using decoupage stains sand paper paints sometimes stencils shes also a canvas acrylic artist and photographer so the walls will be filled with her beatiful paintings i actually agree on and dont find feminine or blah quite fitting actually with lots of thought and time invest i appreciate in addiction to photos she  wants her private lab to print poster size in poster framing but also some on canvas which its that or she said shes photo transfer images to the canvas some tin metal like left over roofing plus wood pieces she has frame hanging sets to hang from wall and saves our daughters baby mobile she made and will place it in her room whe its r messy for that with no financial abilities to rebuild the house solo ill go with her flooring project and later her vanity and countertop epoxy resin fun might even let her get the floor resin and allow her to redo the upstairs floors once we settle downstairs someday and let her try her magic on it or shell go use her studio lol she wont take no for an answer she knows what she likes and wants and happy is wife means peaceful happy life if i can provide her with all her laundry dream soaps deep cleaners and scent boosters ill spoil her with it because shes finding herself again after 25 years since the wreck and a yeah and a little over a month post flood so may obstacles face us im happy oxiclean inspired my wife to her old ways of loving to do laundry except its way more amplified now lol i recommend this product highly your bedding curtains and clothing and fabric table cloths will thank you add aluminum foil balls to the dryer with fabric softener dryer sheets to remove static and a lot of lent but be aware of items you mix and mindful to clean the filter every time even if its such a pain to do the extra step your clothes and fabrics will love you another thing lastly bleach makes me and my wife lose our sense of smell and taste and end up with rashes it we touch any of it or it splashes plus it makes fabric so dense and so fragile and could unravel we use it to clean our concrete thats it outside in a seriously ventilated area oxiclean took place or bleach it looks and smells  better doesnt smell like just harsh chemicals though yes detergent has chemicals just not as harsh as bleach which ruins clothes too oxiclean is a better option a havent had any allergic reactions  to any of it so far sorry for the story my wife gets excited for her bday christmas easter xmas in july 4th of july and her bday cause all she asks for from those around her is gift cards that are visas usable anywhere not just store of choice i can shop around for prices this way that or my cleaning product list to chose from the gift cards go towards cleaning products number one on my h phone must oxiclean variations shes gonna be okay and im thankful sh has laundry as a hobby more then a chore husbands enjoy seeing their  wife and children happy we will continue the subs to different products and keep positive that all works out,very good,very good,very good,very good,very good

"we have a large 4 bedroom house with 52 5blade ceiling fans in every bedroom plus one in and office i am 76 years old and over time it has become increasingly difficult to clean the fans since some of them are positioned over a bed trying to balance on a bed while looking up to clean a fan was definitely not an easy task those not over a bed required a ladder to accomplish dusting the fan

when i found these swiffer ceiling fan dusters i did have to initially do a good manual cleaning as the accumulated dust was more than these dusters could handle now that the initial cleaning has been done i have been able to easily keep the fans clean without climbing on ladders or trying to balance on a bed

we also have a number of rooms with cold air returns at the ceiling again an initial good cleaning needed to be done but now i easily keep up them clean with using these duster no longer will there be an accumulation of dust on these vents because the dreaded job has been put off one wipe over them with these dusters keeps them dust free

another great use for this swiffer duster is to remove dust webs that magically sometimes appear on the ceilings or in the corners where the walls meet the ceilings the extended handle on the duster makes it so very easy to just walk around the rooms and remove all of the dust webs

lets face it cleaning house and dusting is really not a fun time but it needs to be done using the swiffer dusters makes it so much easier to keep up with dusting before it gets to be a tough job since we have a large house live in the country where we get road and field dust and also have a number of pet parrots that generate dust keeping this house dust free has been a major if not insurmountable task the swiffer duster products really do make this chore so much easier and faster this doesnt mean you can let dusting go and expect miracles from these dusters but when used on a regular basis they do make the job easier to keep up with

i hope this review was helpful for you",-,very good,very good,-,very good
i bought this to clean my ceiling fans  but they are good for so much else  i actually dusted all my walls with them  and the tops of doors the stair well and all the places i simply could not reach without a chair or ladder  being 74 years oldchairs and ladders are no longer an option  and the duster weighs almost nothing so it is very easy to use  i also like the width of the duster head which makes dusting the walls really really easy and fast  so glad i bought this thing,-,very good,-,-,very good
super easy to use very lightweight doesnt let dust fly everywhere even when used dry perfect duster it can reach super high ceilings and fans down to baseboards the lock does work well if you click it all the way locked the pads last a long time you can shake them out in the trash or outside to clear them a little im a professional cleaner and this is my go to product for dusting i also have a dust allergy and have no issues when i use this because it traps all the dust and it doesnt fall down on me,-,very good,very good,-,very good
like the old favorite blue dusters this extension pole 360 duster is incredible it really works well  i have an inordinate number of large5blade ceiling fans i am lax in dusting them because the ceilings are also higher than average and requires a regular stepladder to reach and clean them heavy dust accumulates on them in a couple of seasons i just got my new duster out of the box and in less than 5 minutes i have two fans completely dusted it was so easy and i felt much safer standing on the floor than up there on the ladder with 5 52 blades near my head and neck no job too high or too low according to the box and you can believe that high at my house will be taken care of annually if i didnt hate housework so much i might admit that dusting with this new product was almost fun,-,very good,-,very good,very good
"this plus the heavy duty dusters was exactly what i needed to clean my very hard to reach ceiling fan it removed every bit of dust and dust bunny i did say it was very hard to reach cleaning was impossible otherwise and it didnt take me a lot of strength either

i live in the southern united states and when the weather warms up the flies come out in force ive tried just about everything from fly paper to essential oils to keep those buggers out of the house but they always seem to find their way in enter this sonic pest repeller i was skeptical but eager to try anything and after a few weeks of having these plugged in around the major fly areas of the house i have noticed a decrease in the number of flying pests granted i still see the occasional house fly but their numbers have been reduced by more than 50 i call that a win although this product is designed more for roaches and mice it does seem to work against house flies as well as a bonus those pesky drain flies have also appeared to have reduced in number i would recommend this product to anyone wanting another line of defense against pests entering their residence,-,very good,-,very good,very good
im going to lead with i hate pests roaches ants spidersall of them so when i see one i go way overboard with fumigating the entire house typically that works ortho home defense throughout and on the perimeter as well as raid along every baseboard under appliances around window seals etc however this past year has been challenging tiring and made me feel almost defeated and then came this last thursday and friday i saw a total of four roaches within a two day period and for me thats an infestation i bought 2 cans of raid one for each floor and these ultrasonic pest repellers worth a try right? they arrived late friday afternoon i bought the raid friday night overnight friday into saturday morning i saw two dying roaches and one dead roach since saturday i have not seen one dead or alive in addition there are usually dead ants around the back door from the ortho treatment im guessing but this week even they are nonexistent if they stop working i will provide an update but just as others have reported you will see a highly noticeable difference within the first 48 hours of use,-,bad,bad,-,bad

we moved into a house built in the 50s less than a year ago and should not have been surprised of the mouse dropping 2 months ago  while we wouldve loved to identify where the point of entry was we are glad to have not seen more evidence about 23 weeks after installing the repellers in each room of the ground floor  im not sure why there was continued mice activity for another couple weeks before they disappeared altogetherwhether the repellers finally were effective at driving them out and preventing them from returning or if warmer weather and plentiful food outside are keeping mice from venturing indoors is something only the time will tell  until then keeping my fingers crossed that im not wasting electricity,-,very good,very good,-,very good

skura sponges are very different from the basic sponges weve been using for years these sponges work fantastic on all surfaces pick up messes quickly easily rinses out and is ready for use again the best part is sponge does not have a  musty odor and can be used longer than other sponges the sponge lets you know when its done by the fading of the color on scrubby side skura sponges are my favorite now,-,very good,-,-,very good

"i have tried numerous battery brands over the years and found energizer to be the best when it comes to quality and dependability  other batteries i have tried include major brands like duracell and generic brands such as kirkland signature costco  these other battery brands have been a disappointment  the main reason is that they leak alkaline  normally this occurs when batteries are old or have remained installed long after losing their charge  i have experienced these leaks with duracell batteries that had never been installed and were not older than the date printed on the battery itself  believing that this was an isolated incident i purchased additional duracell batteries and had the same outcome  since then i have not purchased duracell batteries

i recently noticed that one of my childrens toys had a white powdery coating developing around the battery compartment  after opening the compartment i observed two of the four batteries were leaking alkaline  all four batteries were kirkland signature brand and installed at the same time  the date printed on the batteries was mar 2018  according to that date the batteries should remain fresh for at least the next four years  the toy still worked and each battery when individually tested still had a charge  the toy was a twoway radio that not been exposed to extreme temperatures moisture or any other conceivable factor which could cause the alkaline leak

i have never experienced this with energizer batteries  normally i use rechargeable batteries  however with children toys i use regular alkaline batteries since children misplace and lose toys  a lost toy is bad enough  however losing four rechargeable aa batteries installed in it is like losing an additional 15  additionally i dont feel comfortable having my children around batteries that leak alkaline  kids are constantly touching things and placing their fingers/hands in their mouths eyes etc  i feel that there is a real safety concern with leaking batteries  for safety dependability and quality reasons i have chosen to purchase energizer alkaline batteries exclusively when im not using rechargeable batteries

i understand that my experiences may differ from others  however the negative experiences ive had were not onetime occurrences  this review is not intended to berate other brands  any negative experiences mentioned involving other brands are done so in order to establish the difference between them and energizer batteries  i hope this review is helpful",poor,poor,poor,-,poor
i use nothing but energizer batteries in my house theyre the only ones that dont leak when you arent looking plus they last so long,-,neutral,-,-,neutral
i purchased this product because i wanted quality batteries energizer is rated as top alkaline batteries and i read somewhere that theyre american made hope thats true a definite selling point as the cheap ones ie made in china last no time at all plus getting 34 top quality batteries for under 20 is a deal i just couldnt pass up a big reason for my 5star rating results from the great customer service rep who helped me resolve a delivery issue regarding my purchase of these batteries when i initially made my purchase i waited and tracked the progress concerning delivery when the estimated delivery date came and went without me receiving anything i checked online and saw that it was marked as undeliverable by the mail service and sent back to amazon an amazon service rep confirmed this fact during an online chat session and set up a replacement order so that i could get my batteries however when i checked online a couple days later i wasnt able to retrieve an order number due to a system error which resulted in that second order being cancelled i decided to call a tollfree amazon phone number and spoke to a very courteous and helpful service rep by the name of shavoun hope i spelled name right she was awesome when i explained the situation about not having received the energizer batteries she took the time to locate the product information and instock availability not only did she set up a new order to ship the batteries somehow she was also able to set it up for nextday delivery mind you when i spoke to her it was after 900 oclock at night she told me that id receive the product the next dayat no additional chargehow cool is that? i thanked her for her help and hung up the phone the next day i did in fact get an email stating that the package was shipped out the message did state expected delivery that day but i told myself it would be very unusual to get something that quick less than 20 hoursno way butsurprise surprise it arrived before 2 oclockthat was roughly about 16 hours after having talked with the service rep i was truly impressedthanks amazonand special thanks to shavounyou really are an awesome customer service rep ,very good,very good,very good,very good,very good

we purchased this rubbermaid commercial heavyduty dustpan its a dustpan not sure what to say about it other than it is heavy duty and will probably last a long time it replaced an old light plastic one weve had for 20 years that finally cracked and broke hopefully this one will last as long we are happy with the purchase and rubbermaid is always a good brand,-,very good,very good,-,very good
they say heavy duty  but they are light weight and thin exactly what i wanted,-,-,-,-,-
it has a great gentle slope requires only 2 attempts to get most dust in the dustpan backward movement of the pan is unnecessary to sweep in the particles it has a ridge so that the dust doesnt go outside of the plan elevation of the back is sufficient to hold a lot of junk its so good that even the tiny particles make it in the pan in the main body there are periodic ridges and these help the dust in the pan sturdy as you move it around excellent dustpan perfect 5/7,-,very good,-,-,very good

"its just a dustpan thats what i thought anyway nothing prepared me for the truth

do you remember the year 1995? i remember it a little irony was the realm of artists not memes when you said the word grit folks still thought about john wayne instead of grade school programs modernity had only partially wiped us of ourselves the internet was still only barely there social media was nowhere to be found we still spoke to one another like people it was a simpler time before we all became cyborgs but a time of widespread ignorance as well sort of like the time before i found this dustpan

but also in 1995 aol was king america was coming online but hardly anyone knew what that meant no one could have predicted where it would go the advent of the internet was one of those worldshattering moments that changed everything sort of like a few weeks ago when i ordered this dustpan

when it arrived it wasnt packed in one of those matte finish sleek boxes you get with apple products but it wasnt the packaging that sold me just a dustpan in a heavy paper jacket it was like any other dustpan or so it seemed when youre holding a dustpan you dont expect much 2019 1995 1975 it doesnt really matter it doesnt seem like dustpan technology advanced that far in 30 years but then i used this dustpan

youve probably been using dustpans your whole life and never thought about what is too narrow or too wide bristles that are too long or too short the rigidity of the brush stroke the angle of the handle or any of that you grabbed some random dustpan probably the peasant garbage included with your broom and rolled with it

but oxo had a different idea they set out to revolutionize the dustpan and they did

remember using a plastic or metal dustpan where all you could do was brush in about 80 of the material while the rest of it slid underneath?

say goodbye to that this dustpan has a rubber edge that is just the right amount of firm and flexible it meets the surface conforms and captures everything

as you draw your brush across the floor the bristles are so soft and so gentle that you barely know when they touch but an inch or two into the bend the resistance is just right to let you know its time to hold it steady on the pull the result? no splayedout bristles no springboardstyle kick back that sends your crumbs across the room

i could go on and on the angle of the handle is just right the way the brush fits into the pan feels like german engineering

ive never had a bad experience with this not once its a joy to use and i mean that bad day? top off a cathartic cleaning session with this brush pan and you never lose that cleaners high

i thought this was just a brush pan i wasnt prepared for this it is a brush pan but so much more

five stars",-,very good,very good,very good,very good
"i have to laugh at myselfi was not looking for one of these sets when i bought it  i happened upon it here and after the  incredible reviews waxing poetic about a little dustpan  brush i bought it

so its good quality and certainly looks nicer than most and works pretty well  for the price with ship included definitely worth it  im an amazon vendor myself and this item is over 1 lb and not that tiny so it would cost a good 1012 for me with my shipping discounts to ship it anywhere in the usa 2022

heres what i dont love

1the brush width is narrower than most  depending on where youre using it that can be a good or bad thing  i bought it to keep near the cat dish so that i could do a quick sweep  i wouldnt mind having a few more inches of width on the brush part funny though cuz the dustpan part seems about as wide as a normal one

2 my biggest gripe is that its actually not intuitive when you go to put the brush back into the bin  you must have the oxo label facing up towards you or the brush handle wont fit into the dustbin handle  i kept pushing and pushing couldnt figure out why it wouldnt go in  once you know its no big deal  but id prefer it if you could just mindlessly put the two together

3 the bristles on the brush after only about 5 easy uses already has some side ones going astray  that doesnt make it look/feel like quality

4  it is definitely heavier than the normal cheapies that you can pick up  if you are dealing with any type of gripping issues related to weight you can keep that in mind  weight often does mean quality and maybe that is true here  id say it feels twice as heavy as the one that came with my lidmore kitchen broom and granted that is skimpy but it works well

5 oxo has soft of a soft plastic grip on many things and thats true here too  i find i dont like the feel of that soft plastic even though the shape of the grip is comfortable

i hope this less enthusiastic review helps someone  its nice but i dont find it great  id also prefer a darker color the white is going to be looking dingy pretty fast",very good,very good,very good,-,very good
i use this to clean up cat liter and it works sooooo much better than the used and abused set i had been using i almost dont mind cleaning up now,-,good,-,-,good
after an incident with wet kitty litter dont even ask we had to replace our old broom and dustpan set this set is easy to use upon arrival there was a cable tie that was a tiny bit difficult to cut off without denting the set but we did it also one bristle had to be trimmed as it was sticking out the dustpan has a silicone edge to it so it stays in place better than a previous set we had the handle has a good grip texture to it too much like other oxo brand products the little broom/sweeper piece stays in the dustpan with pressure not a click like other sets i think this is done because some customers have trouble pulling the two pieces apart the hook that i had for hanging my previous set is a little too small but a long nail will be good the label is pretty well stuck on the broom so im just going to leave it on overall ill keep using this and hopefully weve learned our lesson thus no one will ever use it for things that should not be swept up with a dustpan and small broom in case youre wondering stinky wet gross stuff will stick in the bristles and it is easier to buy a new set than spend hours cleaning it,-,very good,-,-,very good

"once upon a time i purchased a bug zapper racket from an aldi literally like 5 years ago  well it crapped out on me a few months back  super bummer  well my neighbors had purchased the much more expensive name brand version of these a while back when they were not so expensive  and they were awesome and rechargeable  i figured there has to be a version thats pretty similar but not as expensive 45 no thanks especially when my original one only cost me 499  so after a couple hours of researching different rackets i decided to take a chance on these  these were cheaper and had a comparable voltage to the more expensive ones which i wanted that high voltage to fry some bugs i figured if they were awful i could just return them  pretty sure they came within just a couple of days because prime  noticed that they are far lighter than the more expensive ones which it would probably be helpful if i could remember the name of the more expensive name brand ones but i for the life of me can not  but they look pretty much exactly the same  due to the light weight thought maybe they wouldnt be too durable if i whacked a bit too hard on the counter  mind you i dont mean whacked too hard like slamming it like im trying to squash a mouse  but a good amount of force  well let me tell you  these are fantastic  i am frying flies left and right  literally frying until you can smell the burnt hair  i will say i havent tried it on a cockroach yet those suckers are definitely hard to take out as they are usually too large to touch the inner screen where all the voltage is  the only reason i am giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is because even after you release the button that turns the zapping power on there is still some zappy power left  had a 3 year old find this out sheerly by accident  i had set the racket down after aggressively killing a bunch of flies and as a precaution said dont touch the parents were right there too  but what did he do?  touched it  touched his little finger directly between the little protective screens onto the hot screen  heard a quiet little zap  quickly followed by ow  literally just ow so for the most part doesnt really heart so much as it does shocks/scares you  im sure if you did it enough it may hurt so im not suggesting that  just more of a precaution but also dont need to worry all that much type of thing  a word of warning though if you do become too overly aggressive with killing bugs do not be alarmed if you end up with tennis elbow  yes  i got tennis elbow

at the start of the summer my family bought chinchillas and bunnys but that left a lot of brown things all over which would in turn attract flys into the house we think that one of them laid eggs and our whole house main floor and basement was filled with hundreds of flys one day i got sick of it and found this product because i recall using it as a kid the days before delivery were long as the flys kept corralling over the tvs lights and food but each day i kept saying allowed your time will come the second i opened the package i was suprised to see that both swatters were charged no charger included though i spent 20 minutes of over joyous laughter and yelling vengance i made a video of it on tiktok topknotshot the pile of dead bodies and smell of burning bug flesh made me well im gonna sound like a phyco exhilarated i look forward to the next group of flys their day of reckoning will come,-,very good,very good,very good,very good

"i use this downy wrinkle release and faultless rewear dry clean spray  downy is a mist while rewear is an aerosol  they both work on normal wrinkles  the downy sprays a ton of mist which is probably why it works better on the toughest wrinkles compared to rewear  but after 7 or 8 shirts i noticed that the 17 oz downy bottle was significantly drained and lighter  ive had rewear awhile and it still has a lot of life left

the downy crisp linen scent is less noticeable and the rewear  and i like that the downy comes in a 3 oz travel size  i paid 18 for 37 oz of downy and 12 for 40 oz of rewear  with the mist vs aerosol factor i estimate that i would spend at least 3x as much on downy vs rewear over time  maybe 5x

get the rewear if you are looking for the best value or if you like a bouncelike scent or if you have normal wrinkles  get downy if you have tough wrinkles want a travel size option or prefer a less noticeable scent",very good,very good,very good,very good,very good

definitely a good choice for small spaces and soaking up spills the first time i mopped with this the dirty water i wrung out was black i was cleaning up years of dirt that my old spray mop just spread around rather than picking it up off the floor nauseated face

the first mop head obviously needed to be replaced after that which made me worried about the durability of these mop heads but since then ive only gone through one mop head for context i mop once a week with vinegar and dish soap i also rinse it thoroughly after each use and throw it in the wash once a week

for small spaces this is absolutely worth it and this 3 pack price is cheaper than anything ive found in my local store the cheapest ive seen at my store was ~ 850 per mop head",neutral,neutral,neutral,-,neutral

i love love this mop  i bought one originally just to keep on one side of the house but quickly realized i needed more than one with a large house  we have a 7 bedroom house with 5 full bathrooms and this mop is amazing  it wipes the hair and dirt off the pad before putting it back on the floor  i honestly had so many streaks from different mops and this one leaves the floor looking and most importantly feeling clean  you wont regret the purchase,-,very good,-,-,very good

this is one of the best purchases i have made on amazon this thing works so well it doesnt take up very much room like the bigger round buckets that are popular the mop head is washable and wears nicely i still have all of mine and they are in good shape the design of this mop is spectacular i grab it before i grab my electric mop its just so much quicker and convenient this thing made having a litter of puppies running around bearable i love this mop set i would buy it over and over again thank you for such a nice product,-,very good,-,very good,very good

i love the sleek design and convenience of this mop set overall makes washing walls and other flat surfaces in tight spaces very easy to clean i am giving it 4 stars because the dirty water empties into the clean water a third compartment would fix this issue to address those reviews that mentioned the pad bunching up one end of the pad has a ribbon that slides into three tabs on the end of the mop see pictures took me a bit to figure that out,-,very good,-,very good,very good

there used to be a button on top to open it and a button on the back to manually deploy the fragrance they have removed the button on the back and now the top button manually deploys the fragrance you now need to pry it apart at the side there are little ribs near the bottom to insert new fragrance can change the batteries or set the spray time interval this is not easy for the elderly or people with finger issues arthritis etc as i got this for my mom she just lets it run out and i change it when i visit,-,neutral,neutral,-,neutral

our son moved out about a year ago and we had tried everything to try to get his room cleaned teenagers are something else there are stains from who knows what on the carpet in there im not even going to talk about the walls  i dont even want to think about them and i had tried several different off the shelf items from the store  this isnt a miracle product by any means but ive used it once and there is a noticeable difference  i plan on tackling it again the next time i can stomach the room and i have high hopes that with a few more applications the stains might be gone,-,good,good,-,good
"this review is a gross one but i feel that being transparent about the severity of my situation is an important attestation to the quality of this product before i get into it i just want to say that its wednesday night as i write this and im feeling much better now

dont know if it was the kinda oldish meatballs i had for dinner the night before they were frozen so i assumed it was ok the hotdog i made for breakfast or a virus of some sort but on monday i threw up the vilest nasty chunks all over my dark green carpet its a rental and could barely move the kind of vomiting you feel in your ribs and cant talk for a couple days after each time id try to stand it would start again i had to straight up replace my wifi router

i used a small spill vacuum to try and clean up once i got the chunks a process that made me throw up on the carpet even more but there were these nasty blotches of like half digested hot dog meat and bread embedded after as a side note the black  decker spill buster sucks

i was worried this stuff would smell like straight chemicals since nothing was listed but it gave off a vaguely flowery clean scent kinda like how fabuloso is its own scent but not quite that i used this stiff bristle brush to scrub my carpet with this stuff and then dab at the moisture with the included rag which to be honest is mostly just a nice gesture of them because its just a regular nothingspecial rag that does the job

and now you just cant even tell its back to the admittedly hideous shade of green that im sure my landlord got a great deal on in the early 2000s no weird smell or anything like it never happened im going to go buy my first ever bath bomb and order some chicken wings just truly let myself live in luxury after the past couple days folex ceo if you see this just know that i love you",-,very good,very good,-,very good

amazingly effective  simple design lasts 2 nights between charges i added mosquito bait octenol lure which increased the mosquito catch rate 10x the lure i bought hooks on to unit and lasts 30 days  i recharge outside with a battery power pack for convenience easy to clean but the special slim cleaning brush they include is essential it would be a nightmare to clean if you lost the brush i wish the unit had a sleeve to store the cleaning brush the real beauty of this is that after a week the local breeding population of mosquitos seems to be greatly reduced i use 2 units on my back deck for greater effect moths craineflys gnats and those flying carpenter ants looking for a place in my house to infest  catches all that and more one night each unit caught  2030 mosquitos runs silent except for the zaps powers down automatically at sunrise  nice usb c charging cable is included highly recommended but buy mosquito bait too,-,very good,very good,very good,very good
i bought this to use at our beach house in the outer banks of north carolina as the sun sets each evening the mosquitoes and gnats will attack i set this out about 10 feet from our chairs on the deck railing it immediately began to pop with bug hits the bugs were less than usual and the longer we sat the more effective it became the darker it got too after multiple uses the product works very well decrease the amount of bugs making our deck more enjoyable one hint is to clean the bug residue after each use for it to continue to be effective i would purchase these again,-,very good,-,-,very good
we ordered both this bug zapper as well as a corded version and are so glad we did this little guy is going to be a  lifesaver inside our tent when we go camping and keep us from getting eaten alive all night and its smaller size and sleek design has been handy to keep in the house to flip on for a little while in the evening after the kids  have  been in and out playing and letting pesky fliers in great purchase will save me so much trouble chasing things down with a flyswatter,-,very good,-,very good,very good
"even though i was contacted by the company and asked to write a review i refuse to be swayed by bribe lucky for them i absolutely love this fantastic bug zapper

i was caught outside with a neighbor when i remembered i wanted to do a review but had not yet used the zapper one bite reminded me and i popped back inside for it we stood there chatting for an hour while laughing each time we heard a loud zap it works and bugs really like me but today im bite free

i also used it as bait while i was watering at night again im bite free it helps a lot i seriously do think i will buy another",-,very good,very good,-,very good
"i have tried quite a few bug zappers here from amazon sadly they were terrible and the sellers would try to give me money to remove my review i told them that was shady and that people want honest reviews

i love this zapper because it actually works and is rechargeable as you can see in the picture theres a ton of bugs in it and this is only from two days use i actually forgot to turn it off at night and i was woken up by a big zap at 1 am in the morning i started laughing because it actually works i would definitely definitely recommend this",very good,very good,-,-,very good
got this bug zapper for california summer for use at my house but i love that its easily portable to take on weekends away it works great attracts and zaps bugs as promised one charge lasts me for about 2 nights it was recommended to me by a friend and id recommend it to others also comes with a handy little brush to help clean it out easy to set up easy to use useful to also have the normal light function for use as a regular table light,-,very good,-,-,very good
the only thing that i dont like is that the zap is so loud that i jump every time and it takes a few seconds for my heart to slow back down a tiny gnat just flew into it and zap and i jumped  yikes it works great and the blue light is calming but there is no way i could sleep through that zap i like how portable it is and small so it isnt unattractive sitting in a room  mine is sitting next to a table full of house plants where a gnat issue recently started i am adding this to my multiitem arsenal of tools 1 item is killing the eggs but this stops the adult ones gnats and will really reduce the population,-,bad,bad,bad,bad
i bought 2 of this efficient bug zappers and tested them for almost 4 weeks 24 hours all days and nights indoors and outdoors they efficiently captured insects and even produced sounds when insects were caught the attached pictures illustrate results with captured insects inside of these both zappers i highly recommend this compact and fast charging bug trapper the charged zapper lasts all night if left outside easy to pack and use during travels,-,very good,-,-,very good

"i needed a full sponge mop for kitchen floor cleaning that also  has a handy scrub brush to loosen the harder spots this has not only a scrub brush but also a squeegee for removing excess fluids its not heavy or difficult to wring out the sponge but you need to choose between the brush or squeegee to be put in the groove for use on the other side
since i need the brush more  thats how im set up if i will use this for windows ill probably put the squeegee there then for use
i would have preferred my old lightweight sponge mop with the green flat scrubbing pad on its edge   but this was the closest i could find now to replace that",-,poor,-,-,poor
i was able to assemble this mop quite easily in spite of some of the complaints i had read on the products reviews it appears to be designed and built well  its functionality features wringing and telescoping handle are much appreciated  it is not too heavy the only negative thing i noticed is that when cleaning a ceramic tile or linoleum floor the sponge glides easily on the forward stroke but is very bumpy on the backward stroke  the only way to avoid this is by not pressing downward on the backward stroke which i expect would reduce the mops cleaning ability,-,-,-,neutral,neutral
at first i like this mop felt pretty well made besides the spongeis ripped off way too easy  then when i tried switch the replacement mop heads it will not come loose like tried for 10 minutes before pushing harder then i broke to mop just trying to get the stupid mop thing where they say press the button and its supposed to slide out it would not slide out it wouldnt move a tiny bit i have to rip the mop apart to even try a slide out the brush i was never able to replace a single brush do not buy,-,-,-,-,-
i have been using a cedar o mop for 20 years  the last 2 years their mop heads have been coming apart with 1st use called and complained they sent me a 1000 certificate and finally had to give up  been looking for a new mop for a while but am never going to use the spaghetti mop cause those things gross me put  i found this one and with all the reviews had to try it  easy to assemble and was actually surprised at the quality of the product  came with 2 mop heads too so that was great to have a backup  my 14 year old min recently got diagnosed with brain tumor  diabetes and went blind overnight  with that comes her peeing on the floor about 10 times per day  since i bought this mop i have mopped at least 4 times per day for 2 months and the mop head still holds up and absorbs like crazy  i have 4 dogs total and a pet pig in the houseno not my husband and actually 150lb pot bellied pig  and the only reason had to switch to my new mop head is because of all the pig hair stuck in the sponge that i just cant get all out  i will give this mop 10 stars if i could  i have used bleach water vinegar water pet cleaning solution  and i always use almost boiling hot water and the mop head and mop has stood up to all of that  the only negative i have on this mop is the handle to squeeze is a little lower than i like and i am very short but honestly it does not even bother me now that i have gotten used to it go buy this mop,-,good,good,-,good
its a sponge mop it works well the sponge is absorbant and durable and the pole is durable and can stand up to scrubbing the scrubber part is large and makes it difficult to get under ledges but thats solved by removing it which is easy and well designed,-,very good,-,very good,very good

"on the face of things this is a really good mop but  the mop head is a stinker to remove  it took me 20 minutes on two different occasions  to get the bugger free  there was a lot of bad language and i really really found myself wishing that id been gifted with three hands at birth what with the pressing the little latch while simultaneously doing my best to wrench the mop head free i kept coming up short but  eventually  i managed it  barely

oh  and one other thing  the mop head was bigger than any other mop that ive used and so i have been forced to buy a new bucket  maybe i can plant something in the old now useless bucket",-,good,-,-,good
the instructions for inserting the sponge head into the slot on the business end of this thing are hilarious  i quote exact spelling make the two yellow roller and the black iron clamp on the sponge head at the same water level and aim at the groove just insert it  obviously written by a recent college graduate who spent a lot of time in college focused on social justice rather than learning how to think or write  you can figure it out but you are on your own  also the installation of the squeegeebrush part exact spelling dont really make it clear that once you have committed to either the brush side or the squeegee side at install you will not be able to flip it without a hammer and lots of banging while you hold the cheap plastic tab out of the way of the ledge  product made by people intent on making money rather than a good mop that will delight you with its utility  i suggest you keep looking for a better mop,very good,very good,very good,-,very good

"i generally wait a few months before writing a review of a product waiting to review gives the item plenty of time to prove its magnificence or mediocrity however after the first use of this squeegee i could tell that it was superior to other squeegees that i have used

over the 60 years that ive been on this planet i must have used a few hundred different squeegees for decks floors windows counters and glass shower doors which is what this purchase was for i can say without hesitation that for cleaning glass shower doors this is the squeegee that all others aspire to be

the only improvement of the design that i can think of is to put rubber on the ergonomic handle yes its comfortable in your hand but if youre like me and use it as soon as youre done with the shower your hand is wet a rubber strip on the handle would make it less likely to fly across the shower like a bar of soap

i am a purebred norwegian male with strong hands and i have put some pretty nice force down on one of these and my first one still looks about 85 new a 5 solid days later i have tried them all from the ~34 varieties i have come across is dollar stores to several different generic varieties available at target and walmart these are wonderful i already bought another 24 to put away since they are in such beautifully done vacuum sealed bags and i am tempted to buy a third 24 count pack to put in storage these are my new goto sponge/scrubbers a 5 stars across the board,-,very good,-,-,very good
thought theyd be slightly larger but for the sale price of 7 for 24 sponges im okay with it i just hope these are as durable and long lasting as the similar type to these i got another time in the past i like this type foam much better than the other type with large almost swiss cheese style air spaces the last batch of dish sponges i got were those beige color  ecofriendly  type and they started flaking apart almost immediately ill never get those  ecofriendly  ones again,very good,very good,very good,-,very good

"i am delighted to provide a review of the puracy natural dish soap refill having used it for a while i can attest that this is a fantastic dishwashing detergent that is both effective and ecofriendly

firstly the 48ounce size refill is an excellent value for money and it lasts a long time making it an economical choice for people who are trying to reduce their household expenses the packaging is also very convenient with a screwtop lid that makes it easy to pour the liquid into smaller bottles

the scent of organic lemongrass is refreshing and not overpowering making it a joy to use the formula is plantbased and free of harsh chemicals such as sulfates parabens and phosphates making it gentle on the skin and the environment

the soap lathers well and effectively cleans even the toughest grease and grime on dishes leaving them sparkling clean it also has a cleanrinsing watersheeting formula that ensures no residue is left on dishes so theres no need for a second rinse

overall i highly recommend the puracy natural dish soap refill and i believe it is a great product that is both effective and environmentally friendly it is also affordable and comes in a convenient size that makes it easy to use and store",very good,very good,very good,very good,very good
"i had this on subscribe and save but after yesterdays delivery i took it off  i have a lot of items in this monthly order and most of them were covered in dish soap  i couldnt find where the leak was coming from  the cap was on tight and i couldnt find a break in the bag but obviously there was a flaw somewhere

the soap itself is ok but it doesnt suds up for very long  i may switch back to ginger lily or method",-,good,good,good,good
there are so many dish soaps that claim they are “clean” and this is the first one that actually is i love that the fragrance is plant derived and not just “natural fragrance” they get super sudsy and frothy and stick around on the sponge for a long time i would recommend this to anyone wanting to make cleaner safer switches,-,very good,very good,-,very good
smells good and supposedly better ingredients so i dont mind paying a little extra for a product like this,-,very good,-,-,very good

"i purchased the whole set of puracy items to make a clean sweep no pun intended of the chemical products in my home  i wanted to find something that was truly natural that really works as it says it does so i could finally get rid of the chemicals once and for all

natural baby shampoo  body wash  natural body wash  these two items are the same product with a different label but who cares it works i have been searching for a natural body wash for years that rinses clean  i am very sensitive to fragrance oils and have been using johnson and johnson baby shampoo and body wash for my face and body for over 10 years  i wanted to find something natural to replace it  i have truly found it with this product  it has a great scent that my kids 20 and 16 both like and i love it too  very light and fresh without being too much either way  it lathers well and rinses clean which is a must for me last night i even used it for my shampoo and it left my hair so shiny i love it

hand soap love it and have it in every room where there is a sink it rinses clean and the scent is amazing my boys 20 and 16 love it too

liquid dish soap not as sudsy as chemical based soaps like dawn or ajax but does just as good i have very dry hands and also like to hand wash dishes not the best combination  saturday i was baking all day which meant there were a lot of dishes to be washed  i washed and washed and washed and at the end of the day my hands were not wrecked  they were not dried out like they would have been with ajax or dawn  i was amazed that it was able to cut through grease the way the others did and not butcher my hands  once  you wrap your head around less suds youll love this product too

natural all purpose cleaner this truly does what it says i have used this cleaner to wash tile floors hard wood floors mirrors my tv counter tops microwave my front door stove top kitchen table and linoleum flooring  it cleans so much better than clorox wipes and pinesol cleaner  last night my son made egg rolls and it left grease splatters all over the kitchen area he was cooking in we took out this cleaner sprayed the area down and wiped with a paper towel not only did it clean quickly it left no streaks and no need to go over it again  i was and am amazed by how well it works  the bathroom floor is tile and is challenging to get all the crevices clean  i sprayed this on it let sit for 1 min and wiped off and it came right up  this cleaner now replaces clorox wipes in my house  i have place a bottle of this cleaner with a roll of paper towels in each bathroom in the kitchen and in my laundry room the scent is divine it leaves no cleaner residue and it has worked above and beyond my expectations each time i have used it it feels so good to box up all my old chemical based cleaners to replace it with this one powerful and gentle cleaner

over all review five stars
i truly love these products loved how they came in a box without all the plastic shrink wrapping  i am so grateful to have found these products

only recommendation
have the dish soap come with a pump top  i hand wash dishes as they get dirty so a squirt top bottle isnt convenient for me  i took the pump top off of my extra body wash that is under my bathroom sink and switched it out with the squirt top  love the pump top on the dish soap now  makes it easy to pump wash and go",-,very good,very good,very good,very good

as an older person its harder to clean my walkin shower i bought this to help me clean the floor it didnt work quite as well as id hoped but i find it does help me get into corners better instructions could have been better didnt know what to do with the cleaning pad until i pressed it into the brush head i use this to get started but i still have to scrub with an eraser sponge to get the shower really clean,-,very good,-,-,very good
i already had one of these but just recently ordered one for my dad he has a bad back and i found out he hasnt been cleaning his stand in shower for a while he now keeps this in his large stand in shower and uses it a little bit here and there and it really helps him to keep his shower cleaner i myself use it in my shower and for my garden tub i am not very tall and have short arms so this is a very helpful product,-,very good,-,-,very good
i like this product a lot it makes cleaning the shower less dreadful and is efficient you can choose what length you need and it can reach those high places/corners i feel like this is the type of shower brush that youll end up using more often/cleaning your shower more often because of how helpful it is and it doesnt cost an arm  leg,very good,very good,very good,-,very good

"i always liked the idea of a cordless bug zapper i could carry around with me at night in the summer but was always skeptical due to how much power they require to efficiently zap bugs and the expected life of the battery the fact that this product also comes with a light and solar charging capabilities are a bonus

specs
the first thing that caught my eye about this model was the specifications most others i reviewed with decent ratings had a shorter runtime needed to be charged more frequently didnt have solar charging capabilities and also did not have a light one negative i would like to note is that this product is advertised to last 1012 hours on battery but it only lasts 8 which also coincided with the stated specifications in the supplied manual i didnt take off a star for this simply because it still lasts a solid 8hours which is longer than the competition and i dont know if id ever need a full 1012 hours of usage in a single sitting charging by usb only takes 23 hours as indicated

testing
after putting the unit through its paces i can honestly say im fairly impressed within the first 2minutes of turning it on in the evening i had already zapped a couple bugs evident in my photo and within 1020 minutes i had several bugs both big and small see 2nd photo win the light has 2 brightness modes and it flips around in different positions/directions it is very handy to have by the fire at night win i also tested the usb  solar charging over the course of a week and can say the seller is very clear that it takes 20hours of direct sunlight to charge over the course of 4days in mostly direct sunlight the battery was mostly charged and with not needing to use it on a daily basis i just need to prop it up on my window sill by the backyard for daily charging this is a great feature and i havent had to plug it in to charge during infrequent use usb charging was about 3 hours from a drained battery as advertised mostlywin the light/zapper buttons are very easy to press so much so that if you pick it up on the side with the buttons its easy to inadvertently turn functions on or off id still prefer this over hardtopress buttons so ill consider this a win mostlywin

summary
allinall i give it 5 stars for the price even with the less than advertised battery runtime  i dont think you could find a better performing model that had the features and runtime in this price range",very good,very good,very good,-,very good
"been using for the past 2 days and the battery has failed the longevity test i fully charged and placed outside at around 11pm and it went out after 3 hours no more uv light or zapping im disappointed at how little it lasts on a charge and that short mark cant even get near a full night as for the zapping action many types of bugs were eliminated such as gnats moths very few mosquitoes and larger insects such as aphids strangely enough cleaning the unit is a challenge because its a time consuming activity to stick a brush in only to brush at an angle and having to repeat several times because of how cramped the system is id say itll definitely reduce the number of bugs around the perimeter but mosquitoes out of all all bugs wont be zapped as much in order to make it an effective mosquito trap youd have to modify the trap by placing a container next to it with dry ice with a foam padding on top and a few holes to attract them and you can even go as far as to bring out a hand warmer in close proximity to mimic the presence of body heat that way itll increase the chances of increasing the numbers per night but all that is just my idea and results will vary

update seller was very kind and offered to help me with the current unit that didnt meet the specs been using indoors and outdoors daily and the performance is strictly only for bugs that are drawn to uv mosquitoes being the least susceptible in order to deal with them make sure there isnt an area with stagnant water makes it ideal for the females to lay their young",-,very good,very good,very good,very good

indoor and outdoor use this bug zapper can be used both indoors and outdoors which is a great feature for those with insect issues inside the home as well",-,very good,very good,very good,very good
"i recently purchased this solar powered bug zapper and i am very impressed with its performance the device is easy to set up and doesnt require any electricity to operate other than when its completely out of power

the bug zapper is very effective at attracting and killing a wide range of flying insects including mosquitoes flies and gnats it emits a bright uv light that attracts bugs and then uses an electric grid to zap them which is both satisfying and environmentally friendly it startled me the first time i caught one i appreciate that it doesnt use any harmful chemicals making it safe for use around children and pets

"ive seen reviews online and while amazonbasics wins out on value i learned these energizers perform slightly better the absolute best are the lithium types
 so i know i need to replace batteries every year or two in flashlights smoke detectors/carbon dioxide detectors and other things i need all the time like mouse  keyboards
 i recently got some super cheap ones at a local store the cheapest ive ever seen and they barely have enough power to operate my mouse so i needed to buy something soon
 these showed up in an outer cover box inside this one box was two smaller boxes
 i got the aa  aaa combo and in each box of those are smaller boxes of 4 inside this is more for an office setting where people will take a box of 4 at a time to bring to their desk and for me they couldve saved a few boxes except i do like having packs of 4 i can have a spare box in my backpack or bring them on a trip and if any do leak or start to corrode there will be separate boxes to potentially protect others

either way my flashlights are all super bright again and my mouse is operating normally with these
 all the dates state best used by 2030 so i think theyre as fresh as they can be all the ones ive looked at are clean and ive never seen an energizer break open or corrode this was one problem with the cheap ones that made me clean my flashlight in vinegarbaking soda and luckily still works

 time will tell how long these last i use my flashlight all the time especially in winter and while this batch of batteries should last 2 or maybe 3 years i will update this post if any of them leak or corrode

 my previous goto was the durapro series yet the online videos show they are actually not as good as regular duras and in every scenario the energizers out performed them so here i am writing a review

 shipping packaging all far above my expecations and they were very protected from bangs and bumps the only down side that may come up is that they may not last as long as the lithium types which i may buy a 4 pack at some point just to do my own testing otherwise everything i own that needs a battery is now charged with these energizers and the price was reasonable

 i would recommend these to everyone who replaces their batteries annually",very good,very good,very good,very good,very good

this is great for daily use i like that it dispenses soap easily the scrubber head needs to be replaced often especially if you live with someone that doesnt rinse it off after each use,-,very good,-,-,very good
my favorite thing about this is that it does not leak so i am not wasting soap it is nice to give my pots a scrub my only complaint is that you have to pump the button to get soap to come out once it is out it gets nice and soapy but i with it would just dispense soap when you are putting pressure on the sponge while washing other than that it is sleek gets the job done and keeps my sink tidy,-,-,-,-,-
works great and holds a decent amount of soap with an easy to use button the stopped selling these at my local grocery store so amazon to the rescue,-,very good,-,-,very good

hard to tell exactly how much difference they make but it appears they do help some especially when we stopped with the dryer sheets weve gone back to dryer sheets for softening but throw these in too they dont make a ton of noise while trying and our toddler loves to toss them around when theyre out of the dryer they do have some squish you can squeeze the air out of them but they reinflate theyve been working with no problems for over 1 year now,-,neutral,-,-,neutral

then i unfreeze the sauce as needed the plastic on these things is really thin so unlike the freezer bags you cant really wash and reuse these and i wouldnt trust it not leak the sauce but for it being frozen solid  its a use once and toss type situation that said if youre using them for something like your kids pretzels or a handful of fish cheese snack type things that would probably be ok",-,very good,-,-,very good

"if you have a shower door or if you just want to clean your bathroom mirrors or any other mirror or window then this is a great squeegee for that purpose the blade is soft enough to be able to maneuver around anything that may be  holding the shower door or mirror this is currently being used in a shower with a glass door to minimize spotting that can appear on the glass and it wipes away all water and leaves no streaks behind the handle is a good fit when holding and is shaped in a way to maneuver the squeegee to get all traces of water off if you have a smooth shower it can also be used for cleaning it and wiping all water soap or suds off the walls and towards the drain it comes with a base to hang it on that is easy to apply just peal the back off of the base and press it onto the surface that you want the adhesive is strong so make sure you are putting it on something that will not tear off if you have to remove the base

pros works great handle fits well in hand comes with an easy to apply base

cons the adhesive is strong so putting it on anything other a sturdy surface could potentially tear the surface and once base is applied to surface and is crooked then you will need to purchase another base as it will have trouble adhering back to the surface again",-,very good,-,-,very good
works as described but leaves black skid marks on my corian shower pan and walls  not sure if the warm weather is melting the rubber or im just pressing too hard  if i squeegee lightly it works well,-,good,-,-,good

originally came across these when doing some research on sustainable products i saw a mom blog talk about using these and how sturdy they are i was sold  i mean if a trash bag is good enough for a mom of five then its good enough for me these are the best trash bags i actually love that theres no annoying pullstring tie  just handles that you tie yourself it makes it easier to carry i initially worried that plantbased would make it less sturdy but thats not the case at all these feel thicker and better than other trash bags ive used and i feel like they rip way less often,-,very good,-,-,very good
"im a repeat customer of hippo saks and have recommended them to a friend of mine i love the size of these bags and the fact that they dont fall apart from heavy garbage like other namebrand garbage bags do they arent stretchy per se like some other garbage bags are but they fit a lot of garbage

i was glad i found these a few years ago because my previous favorite garbage bags that had a similar handle were discontinued those happened to be a store brand and no one else made trash bags with the same handle style

i dont like the bags where you have to tie them shut because you dont have much to grab on to when its time to take them out to the garbage can unless you dont fill them up all the way i also dont like the style with the elastic closures because the plastic part used to pull the bags shut easily breaks apart when you have heavy bags to carry out to the garbage plus those hurt my hands when i have heavy things to carry finally twist ties dont keep the bags closed

the price of hippo saks and the number of bags you get for the price is a bonus i love that i dont have to purchase these bags as frequently as i do with store or name brand garbage bags the ease of carrying these bags due to the handle style is wonderful and the fact that these bags are heavy duty enough to handle heavier garbage like cat litter makes these bags a perfect replacement for the previous bags id loved",very good,very good,very good,-,very good

first and foremost i have to comment on the amazing aroma of this dish soap it has a refreshing clean scent that is not overpowering or artificial in fact the scent is so pleasant that i often find myself taking deep breaths while using the soap just to enjoy the aroma its a small touch but one that makes a big difference in my overall experience of doing the dishes

but the amazing scent is just one of the many things that i love about this dish soap it is also incredibly effective at cutting through grease and grime leaving my dishes sparkling clean with minimal effort the soap is biodegradable which is important to me as i try to be mindful of my impact on the environment

overall i am extremely pleased with mrs meyers liquid dish soap and would highly recommend it to anyone looking for an effective and environmentally friendly dish soap that also has a pleasant scent it has truly made a difference in my kitchen and i will definitely be repurchasing in the future",-,very good,-,-,very good

"our office has always bought these smaller boxes of tissue and these are the size i grew up with
why do i like them? unlike the supersized boxes where the tissues fall down inside the box once it gets to a certain level these tissue are always in reach right where they are supposed to be
i like the texture of these tissues when i wipe my nose it feels clean not like i just rubbed hand lotion all over it which also leaves a residue on my hands that transfers to my keyboard",-,very good,-,very good,very good
"we always used to buy our tissues at sams or costco but it is a pain since they take up so much room in the cart especially if youre restocking up on other paper products at the same time so now i just buy these from amazon on subscribeandsave and get them to my door every 2 months

as for softness they arent as soft as the bigger boxes you can get elsewhere im not sure why the other thing that is a little annoying is that the first few tissues have to be pulled out very carefully in order to avoid tearing them this is due to the fact that they jam 125 tissues into a thin box so i get it so its only a small inconvenience also when pulling tissues out sometimes the next tissue is not properly folded in so you have to dig around in the box to fish the next one out but that is rare and frankly that happens with all tissue boxes anywhere so that complaint is not specific to this product

the thing i like the most about these is the warning tissues at the end after youve pulled out all but the last 10 or so tissues they change from white to a tan color this is really nice indeed since you can look at a tissue box and know it needs replacing vs pulling the last one out and cursing up a storm since your nose is still running like crazy but there is nothing but a cardboard box to mop it up with  ",bad,bad,bad,bad,bad

i was expecting some nice waffle type dish clothes these arrive hard and stuff and after getting wet they do feel like a bunch of paper towels squished together i was really concerned about this but gave them a try so glad i did these clean everything great they dont have any plastic so they wont scratch delicate thing and the absorption is hard to beat i spilled a fresh cup of coffee all over my counter and floor i grabbed my towel i was using and it absorbed it right up it would have taken a couple bath towels to clean up my mess seriously how can 6oz spread that far i was able to ring it out rinse it and use it over again until the mess was cleaned up they dry out fast so you can use them for a couple days in a row the big test for me was washing i wash all my towels in hot water along with a sanitizer in the rinse cycle and air dried them they came out good as new yes they will eventually need to be replaced but its so much better for the environment,-,very good,-,-,very good
wouldnt think something as simple as this could be useful but it really is ive used the same dishcloth for almost two months now and it shows no signs of wearing out has absolutely no smell easy to rinse and wring out with one hand has saved me a lot of rolls of paper towels when picking up spills i gave several away to relatives who have all said they are using it every day would never go back to a regular dishcloth or disposable sponges after using these,-,very good,-,-,very good

scotch had a velcro like product for pet hair a few years ago that was awesome but they stopped making it this is a close second it doesnt take 79 strips to get up 4 stray hairs in fact i can get the fur from 2 cats off the bedspread in 3 i dont love the perforations  theyre hard to see and dont tear as easily as id like but one strip can do an entire black outfit the reviews say the refills are  but im still on my first roll so well see oh the fur does get all over the handle when theres a ton but it wipes off easily,-,poor,-,-,poor
effective at collecting ham at hair makes cleaning larger surfaces like the sofa or bed a piece of cake,-,-,-,-,-
my dog is a super shedder and i have twilllike furniture so the hairs get embedded this tool is a godsend in my arsenal i just wish it wasnt so costly,very good,very good,very good,-,very good
i like these more than regular alcohol wipes alcohol wipes dry out very quickly these are much larger and dont dry out as fast very durable material,-,-,-,-,-

"this product is ver useful for all my electronics
it does a great job keeping all the different my screens shiny",-,very good,-,-,very good
so the product cleans screens pretty well but i was hoping that the single wipe would be kind of damp and then when you wiped something it would not leave streaks  however the wipes are pretty wet so you need to clean with the wipe then use a microfiber to get a streakfree shine  they smell pretty good not too chemically,-,very good,-,-,very good
these didnt work for what i bought them for i bought these to clean my tv screen they left it more streaked than it was before however they clean phone and tablet screen like a boss they are pricey to only be used for phone and tablet screens,very good,very good,-,-,very good
i dislike the fact u only get a sm amount in package i like them they seem to work well i use them for my phone and my fitbit,-,good,-,good,good
dont like the fibers left on glass does not clean as expected disappointed in purchase,-,-,-,-,-
i have to follow this product up with a dry towel the wipes are a little wet i guess a little dry would be worse but if i dont dry the screen it leave wet streaks,-,-,-,-,-
ive rarely ever been disappointed in an oxo product and im definitely not disappointed in this one like most oxo tools the design of this squeegee is simple but thoughtful and its effective obviously its main purpose is to swipe water off of hard surfaces it does that very well the hook on the handle swivels and the whole tool is light enough that it wont put undue stress on the pipe of a shower head when you hang it there,-,-,-,very good,very good
"its a good product would recommend using

however it is about time amazon will stop cutting costs at the expense of their own customer service the very thing that got them our loyalty we buy from amazon because we know we have our backs covered for some part that is still true but if you need to speak with someone good luck the most annoying people come on the phone off shore and not very good they are well trained and yet not good which makes you want to buy from some else

we needed to replace the squeegee we had in our shower to use on our tempered glass wall and door so i bought this one it has a handy soft hook on the handle so we keep it on the shower neck and it squeegees the glass well,-,good,-,-,good
i was unsure about this squeegee which i purchased for my shower of glass block  tile the blade is very narrow about 1/8 much narrower than my previous squeegee but ive been using this now for nearly 5 months  im very impressed with it i considered buying one that had a replaceable blade but inevitably those squeegee reviews complained of the hanging suction cup losing its suction this one can be hung which i do on my shower shelf which holds soap shampoo etc  it works beautifully,-,good,-,-,good
amazing how fast it was to clean our windows and sliding glass doors  highly recommend buying several  one for windows one for shower and one for your spouse to use on the cars,-,very good,-,-,very good
i got one to hang in our shower and wipe it off after each shower it has a swiveling hook so it is easy to hang it scrapes the glass well i ended up buying 2 more for our other showers,-,-,-,-,-
as advertised the textured handle allows a good grip when wet,-,good,-,-,good
i love that this one has the longer handle because im short and it allows me to reach the top of our very tall glass shower wall i love that the “blade” is thinner and doesnt catch on edges as easily as one of the thicker squeegee blades ive tried others and came back to this one,-,very good,-,-,very good

"well now i know that cfold doesnt mean the same as multifold or trifold
good towels  very absorbent most are squished and wrinkled so they stick together

i bought these thinking the cfold was the same as a multifold i normally purchase scott brand but theirs became so thin and cheap plus they short you 25 paper towel per small pack of supposedly 250 count its really 225 count anyways amazon recommended these as an equivalent well they are not they dont dispense they are folded about 12” in on both long ends they dont intertwine with the next towel so they do not come out of the dispensers at all ya gotta dig them out which means 56 come out together what a joke gee thanks for the recommendation amazon  so c fold does not dispense like a trifold or multifold  i hope whoever needs to see this does good paper towel otherwise just packaging was squished",very good,very good,-,very good,very good
"i intend to take some photos and do a more in depth comparison but here is a start

for what it is meant to be it is nice
it does not replace my more expensive favorite scott rags in a box actually paper towels

 soft enough to use on ones face  its not silk but it is plenty soft for a paper towel  i am finicky and have sensitive skin and it doesnt annoy me  that says a lot  id say at least 995 of the pop would agree with strong confidence
 unlike scott rags in a box which are notoriously expensive on here when bought as single boxes and only recently being listed at affordable rates for the pack of 8 boxes these cannot be used to wax an old car where the paint has been damaged holds up for wiping not heavier scrubbing
 c fold is done after sheet was folded in half
 the whole box of these is maybe about the size of 25 boxes of scotts without measuring
 the paper wraps hold the paper towels i presume in standard refill size not in compression
 plenty absorbent and soft enough for any office to use  softer than the average public restroom  not as heavy/thick as the nicest cfold towels i have seen at a few high end places i was hoping but seemed too affordable and that proved predictable

very nice for what they are but for my home use kitchen house foster dogs garage and garden i will go back to the roll in a box  yeah its a sizable yellow box but it can be fit under the kitchen sink or in another cabinet so you dont have to see it and is now being offered in rolls maybe i will try some of the center pull towels that go in a holder but not sure it is worth the experimenting other than that it would be easier to mount to the inside of the kitchen cabinet and set one up in the garage

to the manufacturer you really ought have a sampler for order on here  a pair of each type of a certain form cfold zfold center pull so the different textures and compositions can be weighed without a lot of trial and error on full size orders  i may be frugal but quality matters and will adjust my price threshold for products  i dont think this was any more of a deal than the 10 a box of the separate category but competing for my business product",very good,very good,very good,very good,very good
no complaints does the job,-,-,-,-,-
we are a dental office that uses these everyday  the paper towels are thick and soft  we have been ordering these from this company for over a year now and have never had a issue they come in on time or earlier than the delivery time and the product is always the same  i would highly recommend purchasing these,-,good,good,-,good

if you are looking for a realiable efficient and low cost set of sponges these are the ones for you my whole family buys these for regular day to day use being a latino you know how it gets down in the kitchen these sponges take off hard stains off of pans and are very sturdy on top of this they last an incredible amount of time of course heavier usage means less time lasted but compared to others these are amazing,very good,very good,very good,-,very good
these sponges are inexpensive and ok but the texture is light and fluffy and not the same density as the real scotch brite ones they work fine but do not feel the same in hand and i do not last as long before deteriorating because the density is much less the the branded ones good for washing dishes and wiping around sink but not good for more intense projects like wiping paint drippings,very good,very good,-,-,very good
i recently purchased these sponges pack of 24 and i am very happy with my purchase this pack of sponges is a great value for the price and provides a good amount of sponges to last for a while,very good,very good,-,-,very good

great qualityi use these in the bathroom on the boat in the kitchen in the camper they hold up and the green pad actually scrubs great price,very good,very good,-,-,very good
its actually expensive  they buy it for less than 2 dollars and sell it for 10 dollars you may as well buy a better one that last longer and is more efficient at scrubbing,very good,very good,-,-,very good

my own fault for not reading details better this merely repels i prefer the one that kills i only need it for ants and spiders and this doesnt seem to do much of anything,-,-,-,-,-

"i live in a slum community in south america where there are lots of pest especially large rats spiders roaches centipedei was consistently purchasing rat poison to get rid of rats that would run into my apartment from outdoors but they just keep commingnot to mention i would find one or two large centipede like snake  visiting my apartment from an nearby sawmilli decided to try this product and it worked very well i placed this product in my kitchen doorway and sleeping area and i noticed only one small mice visit my apartment but would look a little shaky and try to run outi suppose many who purchase this item failed to understand the principal of ultrasoundultrasound cannot penetrate walls and objects however it is reflected or rebound from objects therefore if u want this device in a area where there a lots of obstacles then rats can still lurk nearby because the sound is not reaching their ears so placement is a great factor for effectivenessi forgot to mention too a large one feet  rat visit my home and hid in the corner of my wall as usual but it suddenly ran out upon hearing the soundi cannot say whether this device works on getting centipede out but i will update my review upon further analysisto conclude dont expect this device to kill pest or stop pest reproduction it is only intended to repel them

update 20131211
the devices works prefect for mice and rats but not spidersi have a spider building its nest right in front of this devicewish i can take a picture and post ithowever my main problems were mice and rats and i am glad that it solve my problem however this led me to the conclusion that the ultrasound sound given out from the devices is specifically designed to repel rats and mice only

the devices does not have any effects on mosquitoes i place one of the device on my wall in open air next to my bedi noticed a couple of mosquitoes lurking on my bed netting hope this helps those who are experiencing a mosquito infestation",-,bad,-,bad,bad

the pest deterrent came in a multi pack at about the same price as i paid for one  i found that it takes about a month for you to see results with mice but spiders began to bail out in 2 days  it works best for mice when you keep it close to the floor and place the devices where the mice travel  the higher price one i bought has already stop working and this set keeps going  of course you must not leave food out to further deter pest but his device works great when you follow the instructions  the signal is line of sight so it can be blocked by items in the direction it is pointed  move items out of the path of the signal for best results,very good,very good,-,-,very good

this roller is prefect for getting lint hair etc off i can run it under water to clean and go right back to finish a larger area if needed
it dries fairly quickly and doesnt lose its pickup power
i have used it a number of times and it remains sticky

i do like how easily it rolls and the design is great with one exception the ball design is not purse friendly i wish it was the same concept only slimmer its still better than carrying a tape roller around with a layer full of lint because who actually saves the initial wrapper to wrap around a clean piece and keep it sticky?
i keep one at the office and one in the car just to avoid carrying one around
i would definitely recommend",-,very good,very good,very good,very good

not really too much to say here these are batteries if you have an item that needs batteries then these are handy to have around they come out of the package brand new you put them in your device you use your device eventually all the batteries will be depleted and then you have to put in new batteries thats where this wonderful box of batteries comes in handy ive used this brand for many years and have yet to have any problems leakage or things not working,-,good,-,good,good
i have used rayovac batteries for years they work great and are a good value i needed a quantity of aa quickly and saw the 48aa value on amazon i ordered the pack from amazon but never again they shipped the 48 pack in a bubble wrap envelope the package of batteries was rattling when i picked it up when i opened the envelope i found the battery package was open and the batteries were loose when i put all the batteries back into their package found i only received 32 of the 48 batteries i then noticed a small hole in the seal of the envelope somewhere between amazon and my home 16 aa batteries left the shipping envelope i needed those batteries asap so i didnt want to do a return and there is no “choice” in amazons customer service options to deal with the situation so i got screwed out of 16 batteries next time i will purchase my rayovac batteries where i usually buy them i will drive to my local walmart store and pick them up their pricing is just as fair and i get what i expect in the package,neutral,neutral,neutral,neutral,neutral

"the laminate “wood” floors were in the main part of the house prior to moving in they dont clean as well as my newer flooring in my bedroom they would get filthy with dust pet hair and day to day living and with lots of light coming into that area it was driving me crazy i tried just about everything  swiffer steam mop rejuvenate type products with microfiber cloth mop and even getting on my hands and knees to clean cleaning by hand provided the best results but very time consuming and physically just a pain i resigned myself to the fact the floors would never really look clean in areas of light

i saw this and thought id give it a try my expectations were fairly low after using it i realized my floor looked clean no or hardly any streaks i decided to test out the other microfiber mop pads that came with my steam cleaner to see if there was a difference huge difference the pads that come with this mop are the game changer i will never use the other pads again

the mop itself is like a swiffer wet jet  not super sturdy but its ok since i found i dont need to be aggressive with the mopping i love that i can put some antibacterial cleaner and water in the bottles makes the house smell clean

i highly recommend giving it a try",-,neutral,neutral,neutral,neutral
"i was looking for bucket free mop i used swiffer wet jet earlier it was high maintenance as mop pad needs to be replaced quite ofter it wont last even for 1 room
i bought this hoping i could wash the mop cloth you might need to mop 23 times for deep cleaning but thats how it works with any mop other than that its easy to handle functions well instructions clear my 7 year old assembled for me worth the price as it comes with 4 additional cloth and 1 additional liquid holder",very good,very good,very good,-,very good
"my wife said ive never seen you mop or sweep so i told her floors are beneath me

okay now that ive gotten that out of my system lets review this thing after having gone through several swiffer wet jets over the years and having the motors burn out on me i decided to try something different and found this mop based on the reviews and the price i decided it was worth giving it a try and i am glad i did ive been using it daily for about two weeks now and i cant find much to complain about other than the pole is a little flimsy but its inline with the competitions quality so not even worth deducting a star for the microfiber pads are incredible they pick up more dirt and debris than the swiffer pads and dont leave those annoying streaky lines on my laminate flooring plus theyre reusable i like that it comes with two refillable cleaning solution bottles environmentally friendly and wallet friendly also it doesnt take batteries this mop will pay for itself in less than two months",very good,very good,-,very good,very good
easy to assemble and easy to use  i heard the new flooring should not be washed with a vinegar mixture and it needed to be washed with the non phosphate mixture i wanted to get away from the store bought brand anyway  so i needed to buy a spray mopand this one is fantastic i read a lot of reviews and for the price this one came out on top i am really happy with it,very good,very good,-,-,very good
easy to put together and has a lot of extras for the price mop pads and bottles however the sprayer doesnt spray at a downward angle more like horizontal it still works well but it would be 5/5 stars if that was improved,very good,very good,-,very good,very good
i love everything about it it does a fantastic job on my hardwood floors i have random width honey color oak floors throughout my home the men who installed the flooring recommended using glass cleaner and a microfiber mop to clean and maintain the beauty of the floors i use glass cleaner concentrate diluted with water to fill the bottle on this mop and it works very well using the sprayer i dampened the microfiber cloth before i attached it to the mop as was suggested by a reviewer,-,very good,-,very good,very good
i am very happy with tis mop it is lightweight and very maneuverable the reusable pads wash well i like that the sprayer bottles are smaller than other brands and refillable with your favorite floor cleaner,-,-,-,very good,very good

theyre scrubbing pads what do you say  if you have ever used them you know  this was a great buy for the small quantity so i bought them  if you have never used them the are basically a sponge wrapped in a heavy duty nylon net  they are great for cleaning non stick pots and pans or anything really that isnt super burnt in,-,very good,-,very good,very good

ive been using this type of sponge for over 5 years now and theyre the only ones i prefer from the green scour pads to the soft brush types this beats them all when im out and have to use another type until i can get more i hate cleaning things i use these on my pots and pans dishes glass cook top and stainless steel i rotate new sponges in about once a month or once they get too torn up and when i replace it i keep the old one to clean really greasy or bad things before a second cleaning to get it squeaky clean squeeze it out after youre done cleaning and it wont pick up a smell they really only get torn up if youre cleaning caked on/burnt food bits that are sharp/rough edges or if it gets caught on a screw or rivet,-,bad,-,-,bad

ive purchased 2 packs of these over time they are smooth thick and nice colors they are not lined so they are hard to put on wet hands when they get wet inside they stay wet for a while and start to smell they do not stretch so its hard to turn them inside out to dry i find holes in the finger tips as quickly as any other glove i keep using them until the wetness becomes unbearable and then repurpose them for less wet activities however compared to similar products on amazon they are one of the better priced,very good,very good,very good,-,very good

im a fan of the wipes in general  super convenient and clean really well these were reduced in price and i jumped in the deal and i think i figured out why the scent is far too fruity/coconuty for me personally it reminds me of the blue coconut snow cones i used to eat as a kid delicious to eat but dont want my house smelling like it,very good,very good,-,-,very good

a paper plate is a paper plate right? well actually no i realize these are paper plates and therefore not super sturdy but they seem better than most another thing i really like is the fact you can actually just get one at a time unlike other brands where you usually end up with three or four at a time overall this is a good product,-,very good,very good,-,very good
i know these are cheap paper plates and uncoated/unwaxed at that so i dont fault them too badly for not being particular moisture proof  just be warned that food will start to soak thru these guys after just a couple minutes so eat fast  or put on a plastic support plate or something like that  their shape is a bit more bowllike than many other paper plates having a surprisingly high edge  lastly they are stacked tightly together such that you have to peel them apart in stuck groupings of 24 plates this is no big deal and is quite typical of all thin/cheap paper plates  an excellent price but still a bit lower quality than even ive come to expect  wont keep me from buying more in the future im cheap and can always find a work around for any shortcomings,neutral,neutral,-,-,neutral

good quality tissue but packed too tightly into the box you tear holes in the tissue trying to pull out the very first one you could cut the top off  of the box but that causes other problems the other thing that you can do is grab a thick pinch of many tissues and pull them out no tearing but now you have a stack of loose tissue that you have to put somewhere until you can use them theres other brands that have more space in their boxes so that the tissues are available easily and without tearing holes in them i will purchase one of those brands next time and not puffs because i dont need the hassle or waste just because someone designed the box too small to get the tissues in without being too tightly packed to get at easily,-,bad,bad,bad,bad
"my 15 month old has feeding issues going on so this cup was recommended to us by his therapist it helps with oral motor exeecises and making the “o” shape with his mouth the cup itself is great the only design flaw ive noticed is that when you have to close it you must tuck in the straw when you open it you have to twist the cap off completely and take the straw out of the drink and shove it back in tbe hole this is not a deal breaker for us as we usually just have it around the house and we keep it open for him to drink from independently he loves his bear cup
also he managed to rip the cap and it broke leaving a sharp plastic edge we contacted the company and they sent a generous replacement immediately the customer service is excellent i would recommend this company to everyone",-,very good,-,very good,very good
this came in the mail today i didnt know what it was wifey ordered it i opened the box then text her what ever you bought you got ripped off for a laugh i fill this cheap plastic bear with water and gave it to my daughter 17 mos who hates straws i was amazed when she started using it right away how could a dumb little bear with a cheaper straw work and not leak but it did she used it all day we did have a water mess when she squeezed it but nothing big i have spend so much money buying sippy cups with straws with out straws bottles and she wouldnt use them it prob cost them a buck to make this thing but the way it worked is priceless so simple it works you can read my reviews i say what i mean and mean what i say if your baby is having trouble using a straw buy this worth every penny,poor,poor,poor,poor,poor
if you have a baby like mine that is struggling to learn how to use a straw cup do yourself a favor and get this its hyped up for a reason ive been trying to teach my son to use a straw without luck for a few months and he picked up on it the first time he used this cup i saw some reviews saying the straw is too big for the hole you have to feed the straw through the top of the lid not the bottom,-,neutral,neutral,-,neutral
i bought this cup at the advice of a therapist to teach my toddler how to drink through a straw i would definitely hand wash it rather than put it through the dishwasher because the plastic isnt as thick as other sippy cups thats not a criticism just an observation overall im very satisfied with this purchase my toddler is learning and she loves the bear design,-,very good,-,very good,very good
my sons dentist suggested this cup so he can learn how to drink from a straw and within just a few days he was able to drink from the straw on his own,-,-,-,-,-
it is so easy to use and my daughter absolutely loves it leak proof easy to clean perfect for learning to drink from a straw,-,very good,-,-,very good
my son has congenital heart defects and due to surgery and him being in the hospital the first couple months of his life he never sucked from a bottle or from my breast we work with occupational therapist and she recommended this bottle to help him sack its easy and after a few short weeks of using the straw hes finally got it down its not much to the cup as honestly you could empty a honey bottle and use that but she recommended it and i was willing to try it and it worked,-,very good,-,very good,very good
we tried several straw cups including the ezpz and olababy he instantly understood after doing the same teaching method using this bottle and weve been using straws ever since thank you,-,-,-,good,good
i have bought several of these food storage containers in various sizes and absolutely love them  they are durable leak proof stain proof even with red sauces and reusable  they are also freezer microwave and dishwasher safe  when making big batches of food and storing in these containers i write in sharpie on the lid what they contain and the sharpie easily wipes clean for its next use  they are great for filling and giving away and if transporting something like soup in them and they tip over in your car there is no risk of leaking,-,very good,-,very good,very good
i am a painter and i mix a lot of colors but then i dont always use everything right away or even have paint left after finishing i like to mix enough these are great to mix a specific color and then keep the paint wet for a long time i know there are stay wet palettes but honestly they do not provide enough space for all the paint i mix as i work on multiple paintings at the same time plus there is risk for colors accidentally mixing with these i can mix a lot of paint and keep it separate,-,very good,very good,-,very good

i received this bug zapper and was happy to see clear instructions and an easy to use product that met all of my expectations  the zapper has two modes a lantern style light mode and an antibug mode  the unit automatically turns on the blue light when it is dark which is an awesome feature and we zapped our first bug on the first night we used it within minutes  the solar panels really do keep the unit charged as advertised and we have used it inside our home for the flies and outside with success  we love it,-,very good,-,-,very good
this bug zapper is amazing great for someone who is camping hanging around outside court yards or even when you garden this has solar charging so no need to worry about having to charge it it also is waterproof which is an amazing plus for a bug zapper i love how their is two modes so it doubles as an anti bug and lamp i am definitely going to get another one of these for my father for fathers day,-,very good,-,-,very good

"i like chemicalfree products due to heath issues which usually results in no scent products  i gave up on using essential oil in laundry because theyre too expensive for the barelythere smell they leave
 however the rest of my family likes a fresh  clean laundry smell which equates to chemicals to me  the ewg rating  so i compromise with these scent boosters for
1 cost
2 a scent the whole family is ok with

right or wrong my thought process was to take these scent boosters  dilute the chemicals by adding other healthier solvents to it that are beneficial to laundry as well so the scent boosters arent used alone  as chemically potent i add
1  baking soda which is wonderful for taking teenage hormonal stink out of anything
2  salt which is great for softening our clothes with our extremely hard water

even diluted with other solvents these scent boosters leave just as much smell as if they were used alone  i have a frontend washer with extremely hard water in our area  i put about a cup of of my laundry scent concoction in each wash   yes the salt dissolves in my washer at least  our clothes are left smelling fresh  clean  soft  everyone is left happy

because we are a large family we blast through laundry products like crazy  i find it beneficial for me to make a large batch so i usually try to make a 5 gallon bucket of my laundry scent concoction when i do  as my attached pictures indicate i use a bulk 15 lb bag of baking soda 40/50 lb softener salt  the whole 4 containers of these scent boosters  i store the 5 gallon bucket in my garage  just keep a smaller container in my laundry room

so there you have my long story about why i like these fresh  clean smelling laundry scent boosters  theyre a good compromise for my family leaving everyone happy  im glad they are reasonably priced  sell them in a 4 pack",very good,very good,very good,very good,very good

weve been buying these for almost 3 years now and havent had a problem  the last box though had 3 or 4 of the rolls being of ultrathin paper which had not happened before  it was so thin it was pretty much useless so a big disappointmentand waste of money  today i see that the price has gone up exponentially  im ordering these again hoping there will not be any thin rolls of towels or i will expect a full refund  also the price better come back down at some pointthis is ridiculous,good,good,-,good,good
i was very skeptical about buying this multi purpose paper towel especially because its expensive but im glad i invested in something of good quality each roll is pretty big and would last long its very absorbent especially for fried foods,very good,very good,-,-,very good
when there was a paper shortage i bought a case of these paper towels as a stop gap measure however i just reordered the last box lasted 2 years i use for kitty pickup spills all those things that youd use a towel for  you can recycle so its saving water for us were in a drought they are not soft by any means more like gas station towels but for me they do the trick and they were cheaper than costco,neutral,neutral,neutral,neutral,neutral
as the headline says this is a great towel for the price  my only advice is to not use it in a center pull dispenser  works well with an automatic dispeser  i am satisfied with this and after buying gp premium towesls my last order i will go back to this as my goto,very good,very good,-,-,very good
i have a large dispenser for this product with a crank handle to crack them out as long or as short as i need them  these are ideal  great buy for the money soft  absorbent as described  i love these towels and the 6pack will last me quite a whileonce i run out i will definitely order these again,very good,very good,-,-,very good
"wow wow wow
not your ordinary paper towel the stuff is awesome its thick it absorbs and it is the best paper towel i have yet come across and we work in a garage i need it for the bathroom and the shop
the quality is very good and i highly recommend these towels  thick and absorbable",-,very good,-,-,very good
"i purchased these due to the scarcity of retail paper towels as a result of covid19 they are not a replacement for what retail consumers are accustomed to these are akin to the paper dispenser in the airport or reststop bathrooms  suitable for hand drying only given how much hand washing were all doing now thats not necessarily a bad thing but dont expect these to perform well to clean up a spill on the counter or work like any retail paper towel in terms of absorbency

for example i put 2 tablespoons of water on my counter and tried to wipe it up with a 10 inch portion the result was a wet counter – some got absorbed but it left puddles behind using a second 10 inch portion was needed to finish it off similar to when i try to dry my hands with bathroom paper dispensers – one sheet isnt enough to get my hands dry

so as long you are expecting to use these for hand drying only and not expecting a ‘bounty or other retail brand type paper towel then these are just ok for hand drying

edit after using these now for a few weeks im bumping this from 3 stars to 4 because they pretty good for hand drying and a roll lasts a long time as long as you are not expecting bounty these are good option our habits have changed slightly as well were using these for hand drying and minor wiping up things cloth towels for drying dishes and larger spills and our limited supply of regular paper towels for house cleaning",-,very good,very good,-,very good

the fabric on these papers isnt as good as it used to be  it seems a little more rigidy than soft like the previous papers ive bought from them  therefore the softness isnt there  it feels very rough on my skin  the absorbency is not too bad  it absorbs more than other papers ive used  the value for money is decent for its price and how many rolls youre getting,very good,very good,-,-,very good

"with all the frequent handwashing we are doing these days the standard paper towel will just not do  i use it in the kitchen and go through a roll in about three days  this is the perfect solution for longevity

it is not perforated but thats not necessarilty a fair con  this is a commercial roll designed to go in the paper towel machine and once you get your piece the machine will perforate the paper  unless you have that machine in your kitchen which would be great you will have to rip what you need

also because it is sturdy you will drag your paper roll stand across the counter so you have to hold the stand with your other hand  you will likely not need to do that once you are halfway through the roll  it is absorbent it is not thin and its slightly rougher than the regular paper towel  if you are ok using it in a public restroom youll be fine having it in your kitchen  i anticipate this will last weeks and weeks",-,very good,-,very good,very good
could stand to be just a bit thicker usually have to use two sheets to dry hands but good value for the price,very good,very good,-,-,very good
vastly superior value to standard paper towels although traditional paper towels have their place its great to not have to change the roll anywhere nearly as often or to have to fumble to find the end of the roll if youre like me its really annoying when the towel fails to tear at the perforation and ends up unspooling half the roll when you go to yank of one of the small sheets this coupled with the dispenser solves all of that and is more costeffective since paper towels are used primarily to clean up spills or prevent leakage etc the absorbency of these rolls is ideal moreover concerning the value of what you receive for your investment traditional paper towels dont even begin to compare you get more with one of these rolls by nearly an order of magnitude for each roll of the traditional this is 300 sq ft of paper compared to roughly 120 average mini sheets of traditional with each sheet being around 6 inches thats only 60 sq ft of roll theres simply no comparison moreover the convenience of being able to set the dispenser to autodispense each time one is torn off is a tipping of the scale from which there is no recovery available for traditional towels electronic dispensers are not just for public restrooms anymore especially with their cost having dropped so dramatically in recent years,very good,very good,very good,very good,very good
this is a very large roll of very heavy strong paper  notice i did not call it a paper towel it is very similar to what was called butcher block paper  i use it to wash spills that i may have not seen right away  this paper is so strong i could have used it with a spray bottle to wash my entire kitchen floor  i stopped after about a 1/4 of the floor as the paper was so dirty  when i got a box of 6 it was heavy  each roll of paper weighs over 3 lbs according to my bathroom scale  only one problem  this roll of paper has no perferations to tear off a sheet  since i dont have one of those special paper holders that can cut getting the paper is kind of sloppy,-,poor,-,poor,poor

i dont like that it wont stand on its own you have to carefully stand it up in order for it to stay  other than that it works just fine my mothers old dust pan and lobby broom were shot i had to replace them so i did with a set from walmart which i hated had to chase the dirt line down just to not be able to get it all  this set does beautifully about picking up the dirt no chasing the line picks up the dirt the first time you sweep it in,-,bad,bad,-,bad
broom is much smaller than i like i have my costco broom that i will keep for getting under things corners and hard to reach  the bucket has saved my aching back and doesnt leave a trail,good,-,good,-,good

"i am a firm believer in libman products i had two awesome libman brooms and i loved them
one day my husband was sweeping up his mess and saw a spider breaking my favorite broom to kill it it snapped at the bottom threads where the broom and stick meet and i was left with a jagged broomstick and a cracked hand broom

we bought this as a replacement i will never bend down to sweep up ever again i love the teeth on the dustpan and the long handle i love that the dustpan snaps into place and can stand on its own i frequently unscrew half of the broomstick to use as a short broom for cat litter and cleaning the air intake vent for the ac i got the one with the yellow trim so i can see when the dustpan and bristles need cleaning the only thing i would change is the sturdiness of the bristles when putting the broom inside the dustpan for storage it almost always has a few bristles that get bent upwards and end up sticking out away from the rest a slightly bigger pan would fix that other than that i love my new favorite broom",-,very good,-,-,very good

this scrubbing brush works great only thing i didnt like was you cant put to much pressure on it  i would buy it again though,-,neutral,-,-,neutral
i honestly didnt have my hopes up for this because i only see people using drills with the cleaning attachments and didnt think this would hold up i have 4 other people husband and 3 sons living here that are all messy my bathroom mirrors had splattered toothpaste and fingerprints on them so i tried the soft pad and it cleaned it in no time i used water on it and squeezed out as much as i could because it will throw water every where next i cleaned my tub using the flat brush and the corner brush and im telling you thats the fastest i have ever cleaned my tub and my back and shoulder did not hurt at all im usually just scrubbing and scrubbing and do a crappy job cleaning the walls in the tub because its too much on my shoulder but this was so quick and easy it has plenty of power and didnt die or anything i even cleaned my bath mat with it too it comes with a rounded brush that looks like a toilet bowl brush but havent looked at the manual yet to see if thats what its supposed to be used as but i am excited to try that attachment too the mesh bag is nice because you can put the attachments in there and hang them in your shower to dry it is rechargeable which is great,-,very good,very good,-,very good
what a great product it made cleaning my bathroom title so much easier  the charge last about an hour but it recharges fast,-,-,good,-,good

"this is a wellbuilt product and super functional i cleaned my kitchen sink and it cleaned like a charm no hassle of wires as it works on a rechargeable battery my wife said immediately that we should have gotten this before as we have been cleaning with a lot of manual effort always you can really cut down a huge portion of the manual effort using this highly recommended it for the functionality and the price

my 2 cents below

pros on major scales

 functionality this is really a very useful and functional product cleans well also motor  bristles are strong enough give a kickback in your hand when you start and so hold strongly and clean the surface very properly do it along with soap and cleaning agents brushes are completely washable it even comes with 4 brush heads for different cleaning needs it is great for cleaning tubs tiles  floors
 quality very wellmade product out of the box it is clearly visible that detailed attention is given to build quality and even packaging durable build  assembled strongly
 price very reasonably priced even manual scrubs would cost more than this during a period of time that is one of the reasons i feel i should have bought this before
 convenience this saves a lot of effort an hour of manual scrubbing can be easily replaced with 1520 minutes after using this also wirefree as it has a rechargeable battery that powers the motor

cons
 i wish it had something to tell on/off  battery indicator
 does not have a usb charging port instead has a dc port",very good,very good,very good,very good,very good

the electric spin scrubber iezfix electric cleaning brush bathroom shower scrubbing cleaner product  is well worth the money  i used it on my bathroom shower surround and bath tub  i get a lot of soap scum build up and this tool powered right through it without needing to use much elbow grease at all  it is easy and convenient to hold and use  i sprayed my preferred cleanser on the surface and let the electric spin scrubber do the remainder of the work  i love that  it came with  a net  pouch  to hold all of the different heads in as well  i would buy  this product again,very good,very good,-,-,very good
"i normally dont leave reviews unless its worth it this is worth it i absolutely loathe cleaning the shower/bath tub especially cause austin water has so many minerals in it that leave this lovely orange scum on the grout this gadget has worked miracles minimal effort quickly charged scrubbed like no other scrub brush has before buy this and save your back

"i was extremely doubtful about how these would work i mean  seriously but i tried it boy am i surprised these made my clothes so soft — much softer and more pleasant to the touch than fabric softener i didnt use any fabric softener in my load during the wash nor any dryer sheets just these balls i used all 6 die to the size of the load

a gentleman who installs shower doors recommended this product for cleaning our glass and cultured marble surfaces  when it arrived i instantly recognized the material as the same expanded polyethylene? open cell foam as found in the smaller dish sponges we were buying  at 4 each i expected something more  they perform ok but im not bowled over the open cell plastic doesnt hold water  when dry they are very stiff but inexplicably soften with water and use  the dish scrubbies we have bought previously from another vendor/ maker gradually tear into little shreds of plastic but do hold up pretty well overall  i expect these to do the same but the smiley face cut into them wont help their durability any  bottom line they work ok but arent that special for the price  you can get the same type of product cheaper elsewhere,very good,very good,-,-,very good

the recommended detergent for my dishwasher was cascade platinum  over time i noticed the pattern on my corelle ware and matching pieces was disappearing  i am very happy with this hopefully more environmentally friendly detergent  i will have to get new dishes before knowing whether it is too harsh  it does seem less harsh,-,-,very good,-,very good
cascade is a time honored brand for dishwashers grew up with my mother using it it is effective and now this option is wonderful to free and clear of dyes and easier on the envinroment,-,-,very good,-,very good
just as expected  shipped promptly,-,-,-,-,-
these have answered my long standing dilemma of washing things in the dishwasher and then being disgusted that they tasted like detergent it makes me crazy that every dish detergent is so heavily scented and then the natural unscented ones dont clean dishes at all this has worked just as well as the cascade platinum we used to use but without the horrible taste left on everything,-,good,-,-,good
love the few ingredients and cleaning power,-,very good,-,-,very good

why dont they advertise it?  and why is it less expensive to buy it in the 62 pod container than to buy the replacement pods in the bags?",neutral,-,-,neutral,neutral

i was nervous when i first purchased them in the past ive purchased plastic forks  spoons they were horrible they would melt when being in soup or the forks was not strong enough to hold spaghetti but these forks can hold up with everything i even purchased the spoons excellent quality and i have purchased them more then once will continue to buy them,-,good,-,-,good

these plastic utensils are great and i love that they were environmentally friendly my only complaint was that they didnt come in the display box as pictured found out later that only the extra big order comes in those boxes in that case i felt the ones i ordered were expensive when i wrote to the company though they refunded me so they had excellent customer service,very good,very good,-,very good,very good

"original review

i have lost count of how many different kinds of tissues ive tried and hated they were either too thin so i had to fold them three times for them to hold together and/or there were no clear fold lines but worst of all they shed lint that would get on my clothes and irritate my allergies but ive found the solution in these tripleply ultra soft tissues that arrived today theres zero lint and the need to fold them multiple times is gone one fold through the middle is all it takes to have a large excellent efficent tissue

i will be a happy lifetime user of this product the boxes i received look nothing like the designs on the product page but i dont care i always use a box cover in my photo it looks like the box doesnt sit level but it does that lean is just the result of my having tilted the camera a little bit and i was too lazy to take anther photo

update

well these arent threeply when you get past the first few you remove from the box after that theyre twoply i knocked two stars off my review because of that but they are lintfree so just for that they deserve three stars

ive read reviews that mention how few tissues are in the box versus other cubes theyve purchased that bothered me a little before i ordered because i am using tissues day and night due to my allergies i ordered anyway and im extremely happy i did theyre well worth the extra cost per tissue quality over quantity works for me",neutral,neutral,neutral,neutral,neutral

"wish i would have know about these paper towels before
these are  softer then i expected
working great for the kids bathroom after washing there hands and taking outside to eat instead
 instead of expensive napkins or ruining a dish towel
not often but i  use the expensive paper towels but mainly use many clean dish towels for everyday and wash them everyday with other things
i dont like to waste expensive paper towels  but i dont feel im wasting using these
great for spills camping and keeping in the car also
and yes the kids  bring them back in the house to throwaway",very good,very good,-,-,very good
this is the best value for folded paper towels im very happy with my purchase ill be buying these again i highly recommend them,very good,-,-,-,very good
"i bought these for use in my homes guest bathroom and it is one of the few listings with a reasonable price point for a small quantity

id hoped however that it would have been of a higher quality re thicker more absorbent and softer texture this is not the case it is essentially a couple packs of public restroom paper towels—not what i was going for nevertheless you cant beat the price if youre looking for a smaller quantity",good,good,-,-,good
absorbent,-,-,-,-,-
i normally buy the softer more absorbent folding paper towels which a is much more expensive b is harder to pull out dispenser without tearing these come out of the dispenser 1 at a time generally dont tear almost all of the time bulk enough in that they come in a 2 pack  given that the big box stores sell them in quantities too inconvenient to store this quantity is just right they are not very absorbent but they are more sanitary than reusing towels especially for guests and they dont pill/shed pni use them to dry my private parts because i think drying your v with your bath towel is super unsanitary unless you replace your towel after one use  who really does that? ive done this for years especially when sleeping over at a friends house  i use their towels,very good,very good,very good,very good,very good
"it does the job and dries our hands i recently updated my powder room and bought a paper towel dispenser the price was great so i ordered this one its harder than our standard scott roll paper towels but absorbent enough to dry our hands i would order again

i have noticed it takes at least 2 to completely dry my hands from being soaked after washing them with frequent use and im sure my husband uses more than 2 it lasted a little over 25 months",very good,very good,-,-,very good

"the only reason i dont give it five stars on sturdiness is that sometimes while using it ive had to tighten it back up thats not an uncommon problem for scrub brushes like this sometimes you just have to take a moment and make sure its all staying screwed together with the right tightness

have not tried to use the squeegee part of it but the brush bristles are stiff and durable and worked great for clearing a thick layered mess when combined with the power of water kaboom and giving the cleaning product time to soak in here and there",-,very good,very good,-,very good

doesnt have an overwhelming scent makes sheets and pillow cases smell good and feel cleaner i use it on rugs as well and notice less of a smell between washes good if you have pets or kids,-,very good,-,-,very good
there is not one type of febreze l dont like they all do their job well they never disappoint and worth the money you pay will take away any odor smell from smoke to stale smell  to urine smell great buy good to always have on hand,very good,very good,-,-,very good
i got this because i have started to associate certain scents with the purpose i use them for like if i spray the scented ones in a smelly place i start to associate the scent with the smelly negative emotions and so far it has worked on everything i tryed it on and eliminated the scents so i wont associate the smells it has a ever so slight scent that you only really smell if you pour some in your hand and to me the scent is pleasent but you will never smell it unless you are trying to like if you spry it in the air you will smell nothing,-,very good,-,-,very good

of note i did purchase an offbrand version because it came with 3x the sheets for the same price the difference is that these are thicker sponges and those are thinner sheets either way i am happy with both purchases",very good,very good,-,-,very good

these pads are incredible i love these
recently i bought a 365nm uv flashlight so obviously i took it into the bathroom and holy mother of god what i found there well obviously i had some work to do
i thought i had success with a spray cleaner and an electric scrubber which i use because its easier on my wrist i sprayed six tiles on the shower wall and got to it then with no cleaner i went to six other tiles with the magic eraser once dried i went back to it with the uv light really stunning results
you could see the scratch marks from the electric scrubber and some residual funk on the wall but the magic eraser section was immaculate no trace of anything so this morning i will cut one of these in half and attach it to my electric scrubber and i should be able to see the future in my shower walls d
they did not really stand up to intense scrubbing some disintegration happened when they were raked over loose caulk and such but still well worth the money maybe i should just fix the caulk problem also i wish they were a little thicker i have big hands and they feel a little teensy but thats just me they are probably 30 thinner than a typical kitchen sponge but 100 more effective",very good,very good,-,-,very good

the rubber blade is of better material and good manufacturing so that it stays flat on the surface and clears water away in one try the handle is a bit bulky for women with smaller hand so its harder to hold steady when turning around wont buy those cheaper design with thinner flimsy blades again which tend to wear out faster and/or the rubber blades hardened quickly over time such that the blades do not stay flat to surface,very good,very good,very good,very good,very good

when i contacted oxo customer i got an agent on the phone quickly clearly a us native speaker and a new squeegee was on its way to me within five minutes  no questions asked other than my address what a welcome contrast to the abuse one takes when dealing with most customer service these days i am now a loyal oxo customer  our tech monopolies ought to take note",-,neutral,-,-,neutral

the product is good with no battery defects mentioned in the comments however it does lack quality of a traditional candle lighter first the spacing between the arc coils are too close for certain candles i got this to light tealight citronella candles these candles in particular have wax coated in the candle wick this causes the issues of wax getting on the arc coils reducing its effiency and reliability other than that this product replaced a different arc coil lighter that has same issue with these wax covered wick candles therefore it will probably not last long time,-,poor,poor,poor,poor
this is an amazing electric lighter i love the fact when i light up a used candle i dont need to flip the candle upside down or sideways to avoid from the flame burning my finger when going down when lightning up the candle wick easy quick and the fact that it is rechargeable is a plus,-,very good,-,-,very good
accessible rechargable and lights things on fire works well for incense and candles as those are narrow enough to fit between the prongs my only complaint is the high pitched noise it makes when lit makes my sensory issues itch but its a minor issue and more of a problem with me than the lighter,-,bad,-,-,bad

"i have arthritis and finding a lighter that i could use has become more and more difficult  holding down a safety button while squeezing up on the lighter with one arthritic hand was too much

i ordered one of these and was amazed at how easy it was to use  it takes virtually no hand strength or dexterity at all

i use it to light jar candles all the time  no problem going down into a jar to reach the wick
i use it for birthday candles it works fast enough to get a cake full of candles lit before they all melt down

it stays charged for a long time and is easy to recharge

i have 2 myself and am buying more for gifts to have on hand",-,very good,very good,-,very good

2023  what will they think of next?  this is a real timesaver in the kitchen  when eating something that is hot or slippery i usually just held the plate the best invention of 2022 imo very close to my mouth and used my fingers to try and get the food into my mouth but no more  with these handy things you just stab the food with the fork and then stick that in your mouth  i did use a few youtube videos to figure out the finer details like which side to hold and which side to stab the food with how to not stab the inside of my mouth with the fork and if forks are safe to eat fyi theyre not  im not sure if the name will catch on i feel like it better describes how a road will sometimes split into two or pig meat but im sure the company is still doing market research with this new product  hopefully in 2024 they find a solution for when i want drink water and i dont want to get my hands wet   sent from my iphone 14 pro max,-,very good,very good,-,very good

"cheapest of the cheap when it comes to plastic ware but considering we only use them to stir things or eat yogurts with we dont necessarily need a good plastic spoon i would prefer not to use plastic but some of us bust our butts to an early grave for less than 20k a year and cant afford to have an outrageous water bill every month washing spoons every day overall i really couldnt find anywhere physically or online that sold bulk plastic spoons for a cheaper price than this for the quantity you get and lets be real who really buys plastic spoons for their quality? maybe people who actually recycle them or can afford to be pointlessly fancy

just as people have said these spoons appear to be fairly flimsy i dont know how they will hold up to heat yet but they are crazy cheap and there is a whole thousand in a pack and for me the benefit was that i could get them the same day i did not realize i was going to need them tonight until late this morning so im grateful for that they will sort of do the job tonight and then well have lots left over to use for other nights",very good,very good,-,-,very good

"before using the ultrasonic pest repeller we were experiencing a regular weekly infestation of spiders and wood roaches in our home which was causing us considerable distress despite our efforts to keep our home clean and tidy we found that these pests kept returning and were becoming increasingly difficult to control

however after using the ultrasonic pest repeller we were pleasantly surprised to find that we had not experienced a single spider or any other pest in our home the device seems to have been highly effective in repelling these pests allowing us to enjoy a pestfree home without having to resort to harsh chemicals or other invasive measures

to achieve this level of success we used the pack of 6 devices that came with the ultrasonic pest repeller we strategically placed one device in each of our firstfloor rooms and one in our attic covering all the areas where we had seen pests before we found that the pack of 6 was perfect for our needs as it allowed us to achieve complete coverage without having to purchase additional devices

we were initially concerned about the ultrasonic sound that the devices emitted we were worried that the sound would be audible to our children and cause them discomfort or distress however we were pleased to find that our children could not hear any of the ultrasonic sound and had no issues with the devices at all

overall we are highly satisfied with the effectiveness of the ultrasonic pest repeller and appreciated that it lived up to its claims we found that it was an easy and convenient way to keep our home free of pests and would highly recommend it to others who are dealing with similar issues",-,very good,-,very good,very good
the last two years i have used snap traps for field mice that have found their way into my garage attic i would reset the trap and a week or so later i would catch another one in the meantime i also checked for any holes or entry points around the house none that i could find place steel wool in the bottom of my vinyl siding verticals used the mintscented spray from home depot even after all that i would still find one in the trap every couple weeks it was driving me crazy having to go up in the attic and check the traps all the time or my wife telling me she hears scratching again out of desperation and at the point to try anything i found this  product on amazon and purchased it in december 2022 i was skeptical but it was worth a try and really not very expensive i placed 2 in my attic 2 in  my crawlspace one in the garage and one outside by my patio step outside in not recommended but i covered it with a homemade hood to keep it out of the rain/snow knock on wood since installing these ultrasonic pest repeller units i have not had a single mouse caught in the traps over what is almost 4 months now and the snap traps still had bait in them i can honestly say i believe these things work for me to see such a complete turnaround i should also mention that our backyard butts up to a wooded area there are no random cats patrolling the neighborhood so nothing has really changed from trapping mice over the previous two years to zero over the last 4 months i am completely satisfied with this product and would definitely recommend it,very good,very good,very good,very good,very good

i like “clean shower” smell more but this gets the job done of curtailing the encroaching bacteria and mildew menace,-,-,-,-,-
this is not a deep cleaning product the trick to this is deep clean the shower first then spray scrubbing bubbles after each shower it makes the water that is left on shower walls slicker water runs down the drain fast and soap scum doesnt stick the shower sparkles after the walls are dry spray a bleach mix on the walls and no mold or bacteria will grow beats the heck out of scrubbing,-,-,-,-,-

works on my carpet but  would not use it on my microfiber furniture in my opinion the teeth for removing the embedded dog hair are a bit aggressive for my furniture i definitely recommend for carpet as it also help rise the piling of the carpet i hope they make a larger one for my my large area carpets,-,very good,-,-,very good

"what did i like about this? everything
you know how you vacuum your rug and you “think” its clean? its not
i got this scraper months ago and i even suggested it to other people i know who are now addicted to raking their carpets as well
just about a 2 foot by 6 foot area raked and i had already collected enough fur to make a sweater my velour couch always looks clean but it also was not apparently as when i raked it it was covered in unseen hair
thanks catson
i love these things so much get one i promise you wont be sorry",-,very good,-,very good,very good
i loved this when i first bought it but a few months later im unenthused and bought a different product it does a pretty good job getting hair a vacuum wont but also pulls a lot of material out with it my couch has started going threadbare in areas where i brushed frequently it does a satisfying job on my medium pile carpet however it requires a lot of force to pick up the hair i feel like the handle is about to snap whenever i push too hard youre also left with piles of hair that are a pain to pick up do yourself a favor and buy a product with a chamber that contains the hair i would not recommend for larger surfaces its an arm workout enough on an 8x6 rug,-,very good,-,-,very good

i wouldnt say this is for deep cleaning but it sure beats every other shower spray ive tried  its purpose is to reduce/prevent buildup so you should start with a halfway clean tub/tiles it keeps the tiles clean but it also does not cause a dulling film on the chrome and mirrors as the others have my clear shower curtain liner is totally free of burring or film buildup from product after 4 months of use started with a new liner  the fragrance is divine minty basil  it is a fresh clean unisex smell to be honest this is out of my budget when i can buy an after shower spray at dollar store for a buck but for the amazing results and pleasing fragrance not to mention lack of harmful chemicals i dig a bit deeper into my wallet for this product,-,very good,-,-,very good
"i use this every time after i shower i spray starting at the top of the shower and then the shower pan i focus a lot on the shower pan and all the edges where mold tends to accumulate  in a month ive used half a bottle ive only cleaned scrubbed my shower once in a little over a month and as you can see in my pic the shower looks clean even though its been two weeks since i cleaned it  this isnt really a deep cleaning formula but more of a preventative measure

only thing to note is that the natural fibers have a lot more transition states than a nylon bristle these start off very firm and eventually warp to be quite soft  as opposed to a nylon brush which will stay in a medium flexibility state for most of its life this is an ok trade off for me for the value and lower environmental impact",very good,-,-,-,very good

i love this lighter  after reading some reviews saying that the noise it makes scares them i was nervous to buy this  but since those regular long lighters run out so quickly i figured id try this out  first of all it doesnt make a loud noise at all  its barely a little tssss sound  it doesnt sound like my stungun at all which is what some reviews made me think it would sound like  i love that its rechargeable and comes with its own cord so i feel like its a better option than having to buy new lighters every time they run out of fluid  it has and on/off switch plus it has a power button so theres not much of a chance of you accidentally turning it on as long as you keep it on off when youre not using it  besides it automatically turns off after being idle for a while  i love how long the neck is so i can keep my fingers safe when lighting candles  its a great product for a great price so i definitely recommend it,very good,very good,very good,-,very good
"update after seeing my initial review the company reached out to make it right they explained that i had received a lighter with a defective battery and they are sending me a replacement product they were really quick to react and took a friendly and proactive approach to customer service that i really appreciate
————————————————————
its a cool product and concept but i think we got a defective one of course i didnt realize this until just after the return window closed i fully charged it after it first arrived and then was able to light a candle two times after that before having to charge it again i thought that perhaps someone had left it turned on and thats why it was dead already however i charged it again and it then only lit one candle before going dead again pretty disappointing",-,-,bad,-,bad
my dad kept spending 8 on lighters every weekend and refused to buy one of these because he thought it would be junk so i waited until i got some allowance and bought this for him he was reluctant at first but now he has ajusted to the different aim needed to light candles and admits that not spending money on lighters is nice this one die? just plug it in for an hour and your good for another few weeks depending how often you light candles and if you forget to turn it off after use i win i have won the ageold battle of trying to one up my dad and i won a battle,very good,very good,-,-,very good
its so nice to have a lighter that works as consistently as this one does no more clicking a disposable light 50 times to get a flame just one click with this and youve got an immediate spark it takes a little getting used to lining up the little arc to your candle wick but its still way less frustrating than a disposable lighter plus you never have to throw it away as its rechargeable,-,poor,poor,-,poor
ive never had an electric candle lighter before but this one works great  the bendable neck makes it less awkward to light deeper candles without burning your hand  i use it often not every day but probably 5 days out of any given week and ive had it for over a year and the battery is still going strong,-,very good,-,-,very good
"i bought the two pack because i like the size and sleek design one of them however died three days after the amazon return window closed i contacted ronxs customer support and they never replied reliability of these lighters seems to be a problem

update once i posted this review ronxs customer support contacted me and shipped out a replacement that has an improved battery i am quite impressed by how quickly they responded and i hope the new ones work better",-,very good,-,very good,very good
no one smokes in our house and we do keep a spare lighter around just for birthdays or everyday candles  but it is sometimes tough to get a good angle to light the wicks  this is the perfect long term solution for all of our lighting needs  super easy to charge and use it allows plenty of distance between skin and lighting and is perfect for all our needs,-,very good,very good,-,very good
overall it was a good buy i bought it for my best friend who loves candles it makes a buzzing sound like you would expect and it lights candles pretty well the only thing id say is the battery life was a little weird it would say it was charged fully but then it would randomly die not too big of a deal because she just charges it again after using it but if you are looking for one that will last a while maybe if you are going camping or something id say this might not be the one you want to buy,-,good,good,-,good
initially i got these gloves for cleaning because i have sensory issues and have a hard time touching specific textures anything sticky oily things with ridges etc i have used different pairs of gloves in the past but they always leave a powdery residue or yellow lining around my hands not to mention the smell of rubber tends to linger even after washing my hands these gloves are absolutely perfect not only do they fit well but they are odorless and do not leave any residue on my hands since they are odorless i have found uses for them in my kitchen while cooking as well i will be purchasing these again i rarely vouch for any company product or brand however i love this product and i am so grateful i finally have been able to complete many tasks around my apartment without worrying about the texture of what i am cleaning also no this was not sponsored lol i just really enjoy this product,-,very good,very good,-,very good

"my humidifier requires frequent cleaning because it is filterless every week or 2 you are supposed to clean it with vinegar and/or disinfect it with bleach

if i let it go 2 or more weeks without cleaning it seemed to accumulate orange gunk i decided to add the fish because of this recently it has gotten warmer out and i no longer needed to use the humidifier admittedly i left it with water in it for probably 2 months because i didnt feel like cleaning it i just opened it up to clean it for the summer and to my surprise no gunk at all before the fish it would have orange build up after just 2 weeks and now it went months with the fish in it and didnt build up orange gunk

next winter i will definitely be stocking up on these to use throughout the season",-,very good,-,-,very good

i didnt order these filters to use for loose coffee as they are designed i was having a problem with coffee grounds getting into my cup when using the regular kcup  i first tried a tiny piece of paper towel placed under the kcup and found that that seemed to work in catching any loose grounds that might get out of the kcup  rather than cutting tiny pieces of paper towel to use each time we wanted a single cup of coffee i found these filters online  i place the kcup fully intact in side the paper filter and place it in the dispenser in the coffee machine  this seems to work great in catching any loose grounds that want to jump out of the kcup during the  brewing process  so as far as how these work with loose coffee im assuming they work fine as designed  but when looking for a diy to fix a groundsjumpingoutofthekcup problem these are great,-,good,good,good,good
"i brew finally ground coffee in my reusable kcups  i loved it but got grounds and bitterness at the bottom of the cup — not “good to the last cup”

i had to switch providers because several months ago this other company took steps to severely degrade their product by thinning the paper and reducing the overall capacity or size  those filters became absolutely useless  these new filters are sooo much better with thicker paper and more capacity  since the other company went down the cost reduction road unsuccessfully i sure hope this company xmcosocs does not do that,poor,poor,poor,-,poor

"i use this everywhere inside and outside its effective at zapping all those pesky insects that make life miserable i really like the lightweight portable design its super easy to clean it out by just blowing on it over a trash can or just shake it out onto your yard

want an easy fix to your bug problemjust buy this",-,very good,very good,very good,very good
"ive been on a quest to only buy new portable devices that charge via usbc its been over 7 years now and ive amassed many devices and chargers so i was excited to add another to the list with this bug zapper

unfortunately this only works with usba to usbc cables my quest to charge all the devices with one usbc cable has now hit a snag if you have an actual usbc brick and consequently a cable with usbc on both ends nothing will happen

i tested with multiple bricks and cables and the one constant was a usba brick with a usba to usbc cable is the only thing that would charge this

ok so it needs a bandaid cable to charge what else isnt so good with this?

theres no tray to catch the bugs once theyre zapped might seem like a good thing since theres no tray to clean except you wont want to let this thing sway around if you hang it somewhere like inside your tent all those bugs you zapped over the 5ish hour battery life might come down raining onto your sleeping bag or worse inside your mouth

enough of the bad theres some good the control buttons are sturdy and well labelled the lamp is plenty bright and the zapper has a deep purple glow similar to a reflection off a blacklight this thing is fairly compact and light weight so its good for portability

i literally just unboxed this thing so well see how it performs over time i guess it works in the rain but i dont expect too many bugs in that scenario",-,poor,poor,poor,poor
this is the 3rd bug zapper ive ordered the 1st one worked great all summer but i had to replace it when the handle broke so it fell a few feet onto grass  the top popped off  ive found the easiest way to clean it before bringing it inside is to shake it gently over the edge of the deck so the dead bugs fall out given the handle isnt as sturdy as i thought i wont be doing that any more  the replacement i ordered had a faulty connection the button for lights worked but the button for bugs did not so i returned it  ordered this one  it arrived quickly  worked perfectly right out of the box  what i like about this model is that its lightweight portable  rechargeable both by usb  by solar panel on the top the violet bug light isnt obnoxiously bright the charge lasts a very long time so far ive only use it for bugs not for light  its quiet ~ you only hear that unnerving snap when a very large bug flies into it which is rarely  meanwhile we can enjoy sitting outside in the evenings w/o getting bitten  im normally bug bait  ive even stopped using citronella candles b/c we no longer need them  and i do see bats around occasionally so i know weve still got bugs  highly recommend,-,very good,very good,very good,very good

"ive had this for over a month  its probably only killed 4 bugs we live near a paddock for horses cows  sheep so we have flies around our house like crazy
i wanted to try the solar option since our outdoor electric sockets arent close to our outdoor patio or doors it just doesnt work the way it should even if its out in bright sun for days it turns itself off the bugs dont seem to be attracted to the light so id call it a fail i pretty much use it for the flashlight when i take the trash out at night
update
one night i left the zapper part on just for giggles  the next morning it was absolutely full of bugs i was shocked so i kept testing it in different places and found it really is up to ambient light
if its bright daylight the bugs arent going to care about the zapper indoors it totally took care of the flies that come in with us  bother my guinea pigs fruit flies from bananas are gone too its just best to use in dim or full dark is that something other people knew and i didnt? i thought theyd see the light differently and be attracted to it no matter the ambient light
ok so ive learned and now i appreciate this bug zapper much more
now that there are bugs to clean off i just spray it with my hose easypeasy and no fuss it comes with a brush in case you have any dried on corpses that need to be dislodged
i still rate 4 stars because im not thrilled with how long it takes to charge in the sun we get tons of sun here and it doesnt fully charge the zapper even if its out all day
now that i know how to best use it i do like it a lot just be aware that it works best in dim or dark as im writing this now i think about putting it under my deck to see if i can get more flies gone that way   
its a reasonable price so id recommend giving this zapper a try it cant hurt you but it might kill a fly haha couldnt resist a rhyme winking face",very good,very good,-,-,very good
had my doubts about it but it worked pretty good liked that it didnt need to be connected to an outlet you can put it anywhere,-,very good,-,-,very good
the bug light does indeed kill those pesky mosquitos and other small flying insects when they land on it i use this outdoors in the louisiana open air after several nights there were mosquitoes and other insects dead on the light as buggy as it was i expected to see a light full of those pesky suckers id say 15 mosquitoes at most and a few other insects not as many as i hoped for but hey they werent on me the flash light function is very bright i love that it can charge either through solar or electrical outlet,-,very good,-,-,very good

they used to be 10 x 12 for our latest case of 8 they shrank them to 9 x 12  they didnt change the part number or anything they just trimmed 10 off each towel the price stayed about the same but id rather have paid a bit more because i understand how inflation works we actually do notice the difference when using the smaller towels especially when we use them as tray liners for our work,neutral,neutral,-,-,neutral

ordered these a few months ago and they were nice and big a little softer than the rolls which i really liked since i use them for tattooing this new shipment however the towels are rougher and not as evenly blended you can see some bits of irregular fibers sticking out of some sheets and an inch or two shorter than the previous shipment per sheet,-,very good,very good,-,very good
love this product and use it for almost everything  the only down side is that the box is designed for display and quick retrieval of a roll of towels  this is fine if the transport of the box is done properly  if not the box breaks open  this has happened to we twice out of 15 or more orders so not bad however one of the two deliveries was half empty  yes they not sure who they are had taped up the destroyed box with half of the rolls missing as if this was a completed order  honestly amazon true to is policy refunded my money for this order and sent me a label for shipping back to them  i recommend the product and amazon,very good,very good,very good,very good,very good
i clean my car at least 2x a week and i keep a box of these towels in my trunk  i use them to clean my windows and to armor all my interior  i also use them to wipe the outside of my car  they are strong and one towel can clean my entire windshield and windows inside and out  great product and ill continue to buy,-,very good,-,very good,very good

"my first dog winnie went to heaven 3 days ago i ordered this urn necklace a couple days before it happened out of anticipation since she had been very ill i got the one with the 2 little paw prints on the heart i thought out of all the memorial necklaces on amazon this one was by far the cutest and most elegant i like how small it is its not bulky at all so if you want to wear it as a necklace or keychain it wouldnt be gaudy or heavy

i decided not to receive her ashes for various reasons instead i kept some of her fur it reminds me of how soft she was and how comforting it was petting her the urn necklace cant hold very much but i was able to get a nice pinch of fur to fit in there snugly please keep in mind that she was a short haired dachshund and even then her hair was too long for the urn and i had to trim it slightly so if you plan on putting your pets hair in here it may not be suitable for longer haired dogs

i decided not to wear the necklace or attach the split keyring it came with to make a keychain because i dont want to risk losing it however since i have some more of her fur i may purchase another one to keep on my keys that way shes always with me as of now i have the necklace hanging where i hang her leash up on the wall near my bedroom door along with the necklace i hung her collar above these items i placed the card that has her inked pawprints i see her little memorial every time i enter and leave my bedroom it fills me with sorrow but it also helps me remember how grateful and blessed i am to have had her in my life for 13 wonderful years she was the epitome of love and i never want to forget her

this urn was perfect for that i cried when he died i cried when i had to order this and i cried some more when it arrived in the mail its very small but perfectly for what i need because i wear it all the time rather than put his ashes inside i grabbed several pieces of his hair everyone with a gsd can tell you that theyre awful shedders so i had plenty of hair to try to get in there and put them in instead it really sucks that this happened but this urn made it a little bit easier",-,-,bad,-,bad

"once upon a time in a home far far away there was a messy kitchen with dirty floors that seemed to never stay clean the resident of the house a busy mother of two was fed up with her old mop that left streaks on her floors and never seemed to get the job done that is until she discovered the ocedar promist max microfiber spray mop in a vibrant shade of red

first of all let me say that this mop is a gamechanger no more buckets of dirty water no more streaky floors and no more hassle the ocedar promist max microfiber spray mop is easy to assemble and comes with a reusable microfiber pad that can be washed and reused multiple times

the spray feature is what sets this mop apart from others on the market its so simple to use  just fill the refillable bottle with your favorite cleaning solution attach it to the mop and spray away the mist is fine and evenly distributed so you dont have to worry about soaking your floors or wasting cleaning solution

one of the best things about this mop is its ability to get into tight spaces and corners making it perfect for cleaning around furniture or in small bathrooms the mop head swivels 360 degrees which means you can easily maneuver it around obstacles without having to constantly stop and readjust

the only reason im not giving this mop a full 5 stars is that the handle can be a little flimsy at times i have to be careful not to put too much pressure on it when scrubbing tough spots or it might bend or break

but wait theres more another great feature of this mop is that it can be used on a variety of surfaces including hardwood tile laminate and more this makes it incredibly versatile and perfect for any household

in addition the microfiber pad is excellent at picking up dirt and grime leaving floors spotless and shining plus the fact that its reusable means youll save money in the long run and help reduce waste

the only downside is that you do have to wash the microfiber pad frequently to keep it clean and effective however this is a small inconvenience compared to the convenience and efficiency this mop provides

on top of all that the ocedar promist max microfiber spray mop is also lightweight which means you wont have to strain yourself while cleaning the handle is comfortable to hold and the mop is easy to push around this makes it perfect for people with mobility issues or anyone who doesnt want to spend too much time cleaning their floors

one thing to keep in mind is that the refillable bottle is on the smaller side so you may have to refill it a few times during your cleaning session however this is a minor inconvenience that doesnt detract from the overall quality of the mop

in terms of durability ive been using this mop for several months now and its held up well the microfiber pad is still in good condition and the spray feature hasnt malfunctioned or stopped working

overall the ocedar promist max microfiber spray mop is a fantastic investment for anyone who wants to make cleaning their floors a breeze its efficient easy to use and a great value for the price plus the red color is just so darn fun i highly recommend it",very good,very good,very good,very good,very good
i add two teaspoons of cleaner like the instructions say and fill the container with water it does a fantastic job the pad is easy to get on and off the mop follow the laundry instructions and it comes clean and doesnt shrink the dry flat instruction was much less of a pain in the neck than i thought it would be i got the mop that came with three pads total i havent had to switch to another pad yet but its good to know i have the spares just in case i need them from the way the pad cleans up without messing up the pad at all i figure it will be a while before i have to break into a refill pad the fact that you can use both sides of the pad without having to do anything but flip the pad over while still on the mop makes life a lot easier i highly recommend this mop,-,very good,-,very good,very good
i rated a 4 star since it took some practice to aim the spray closer to the mop head rather than 6 feet across the room and the mop head pad is a bit difficult to gracefully remove and replace  the cleaning results on my bamboo wood floor were a bit  streaky until i realized the floor was very dirty and needed a few washings with a good amount of cleaner applied  the the mop head pad washes beautifully and releases all the black dirt when my bona mop heads and other types dont ever come clean  the best is the built in spray featureso much better than carrying a spray bottle and wearing my hand out,-,very good,-,very good,very good
i got this spray mop because dragging a dripping mop from the kitchen all over my house is annoying im not overly fond of bucket mops because it just adds extras steps and youre still mopping with dirty water this works ok its not going to replace your mop for deep cleaning the reservoir is a nice size the mop clothes are very good quality and wont scratch your floors theyre thick enough you can really scrub with them the mop handle is short im 5 4” with shoes on and i feel like i could use a longer handle its not a deal breaker though but keep in mind if youre closer to 6 feet this is probably going to be uncomfortable to use the handle seems sturdy enough but i wouldnt get too rough with it overall i like it enough to keep it but i dont know if i would necessarily recommend it as a game changer to anyone else ill mostly use it in the bathrooms and for light cleaning,-,neutral,-,-,neutral
"none of them 10 out of 10

 sprays pretty wide and far enough

finally bought my second one of these after using it to clean houses for work for the last year i clean full time seasonally and parttime year round and one mop has lasted me and is still going i bought a second one just to have it and because i will say that my old one leaks if its leaning back too far but its not much of an issue and its probably my fault from dropping it daily haha the mop juice bottle attached holds enough to mop a whole house sometimes two the spray range is really nice the mop head styles are perfectly versatile and give a deeper clean than when ive used just the bona microfiber mops these get the job done and more thoroughly than a swiffer/bona but with less fuss than a big old school mop,-,very good,very good,very good,very good
bought this for the store i work for  takes to long to get tools needed for store so i bought this since the mop we used was broken im sure in time the clamp will grow dull and weak but for the time being it does amazing work in restaurant  we clean our floors regularly for safety and sanitary purposes its been used 30 times in the last 4 days so far,-,very good,very good,-,very good
its been great was wondering how sturdy the plastic tightener was going to be but it has held up perfectly so far really like how quick and easy it is to load the mop head stays put another great feature is that when you loosen it to remove the mop head you can just hold it with mop facing down and it will drop out of the clamp without even having to touch the dirty mop sometimes the handle gets a little loose but thats just the nature of screw together products and definitely not worth removing a star,-,-,very good,-,very good

the water level didnt seem to go down at all so i went ahead and started using my plunger to unclog the toilet after about 23 pushes the toilet become unclogged
i then flushed the toilet about 5 times and use little toilet paper in between to make sure it was still flushing properly with paper
i would say if you know for sure your toilet is clogged with just toilet paper or similar material this stuff works just gotta be patient
it also may sound silly but during my research i also found a video on how to plunge the toliet correctly when clogged to this extent basically make sure you have some water pressure and not just air angle your plunger

i love the sleek look of the lighters but my deciding factor of purchasing this was after a trip to the beach and enjoying early deck weather that i ordered two because of aging fingers those older butane torch lighters are becoming harder to use honestly i was surprised at the ease of charging and using the lighter just one click i was able to light my citronella with ease i highly recommend i did not rate the battery life because i have only charged it once and dont use it every day but so far so good,-,very good,-,-,very good

"i must say this is bar non the best electric lighter one can use for candlesi have burnt my finger and have gotten hot wax on my clothes as i try to tip the candle as the flame sometimes get so big maybe my wick was too longmaybe

"perhaps i am not using it right but mine dies after i try to light something about 68 times and because it can take 24 tries to light something once because the electrical spark quickly goes out the battery dies after lighting a couple of candles which means i have to put it on the charger every time i light some candles in the house sometimes it doesnt even have enough energy on a fully charged battery to light 4 candles across the house dont judge my candle addiction okay

i really want to like this and i dont want to use traditional lighters if i can so ill continue to try to get a hang of it but ive had it for a couple of months now and with how often i light candles ive found myself giving up and reaching for a regular lighter quite often",-,very good,very good,-,very good

they are not bad acceptable but above all comfortable and aesthetic they bring you 3 with the mini plate its bamboo and it scratches very well i liked them for the comfort of using them it can be used with good pressure and the hairs remain fixed from 1 to 10 i give it a 75 tip do not put them in clorox they will soften like paintbrushes at home

hardness comparison

1 like straight hair
2 like drawing brushes
3 as brushes to paint the house
4 somewhat normal but still soft
5 normal neither hard nor soft
6 normal but somewhat more resistant
7 as a soft hairbrush
8 the brush as strong as the toilet bowl
9 very hard harder than the cleaning brush
10 like a wire brush

my opinion is 75

believe it or not i imagined buying wire brushes to not keep buying over time xd i imagine that those take out even the most stuck like rice or black and burnt food

"i dont write reviews often and it seems silly to say this about a dish scrubber but i felt compelled to write a positive review we had one dish scrubber before having already found them superior to sponges and this is a major upgrade the bamboo handles and sisal bristles are excellent quality and the ceramic dish is sturdy and slightly larger than the brushes for 12 im set for at least a few months and will be able to buy more brushes while keeping the sweet dish

are they sturdy and durable? nobut that is not what they are meant for they are to keep your food waste in until you get it to the compost bin they will not prevent leakage if you leave the food waste in the bag for more than a weekfound that out but this just means that they definitely do as promised they biodegrade and become part of your compost like they are meant to so if youre looking for sturdy sandwich baggies or something they will work if you eat your sandwich within a day or two leave your sandwich on the car seat for a couple days and you will find it leaking as it starts to biodegrade,-,very good,-,-,very good

trued this out for the first time this past weekend while on a camping trip the wipes are much larger and thicker than the flushable type and works great for wiping down the body i used it from face down to bottom of feet once the moisture dried off my skin i felt much cleaner i will definitely be buying more and finding other opportunities to put these wipes to use,-,very good,very good,-,very good
"when surviveware says these wipes are perfect for posterior pamperingthey are absolutely right  i have a rare medical condition called short bowel syndrome which basically means that i have to “go” every hour 24/7/365  this requires a whole lot of daily scrubbing of alreadysensitive skin sometimes during episodes of “diaper rash” yeast infection leading to painful skin degradation and ulcers  im a physician myself so believe me when i say that ive literally tried every bathroom and body wipe available in the us finding these wipes has changed everything for me in that area in the most positive way i could have imagined  these wipes are so soft they clean skin very well without needing to exert a lot of pressure theyre also quite large so while theyre more expensive than some other brands i only need one wipe to get the job done so in the end pun intended i actually save money buying these instead of cheaper wipes which dont work nearly as well theyre very strong no ripping or tearing while using them

since i started using the surviveware wet wipes my skin has significantly healed no more painful ulcers  and when i do happen to get a yeast infection/diaper rash much less often than before btw leaving my posteriors skin tender and very sensitive to touch i no longer experience the stinging or burning that i used to from the added fragrances alcohol and other unnecessary chemicals or ingredients in other brands of wet wipes

another big plus in the large multiplewipe package the last wipe is just as wet as the first
i buy these in large packs for home and in individual packets for going out

most packs containing multiple wet wipes have a sticky resealable tab to ostensibly keep the wipes moist however in most other brands ive tried usually the bottom 1/3 of the wipes inside the pack are either all or partially dried out by the time you get to them

not survivewares  while their multiwipe pack has a very sticky seal tab as well it also has a hard plastic “box” covering the tab that clicks tightly closed ensuring that the last wipe in the pack will be exactly as wet as the first  another moneysaving feature

the individual packets with one wipe are small and thin i can fit several into a small handbag  and the little packets themselves are understated mostly blackthey dont scream out “hey im a bottom wipe”

even my teenage sons will carry these individual wipe packets in their backpacks or in their shorts pockets when they go running or play bball pickup gamesand thats solely because these packets are so understated/black

all 5 of my kids use these wipes for everything else theyre advertised to do  since all of my kids are involved in multiple sports they say these wipes are lifesavers when they simply dont have time after pe practice or games to shower before going to class or to another event

finally i am happy to support this small business primarily due to their commitment to improving the environment  i like the fact that these wipes are biodegradable although i dont flush them theyd be a great asset on camping trips and of course since bamboo is a natural renewable resource these are so much better for the environment than is paper

their customer service department is excellent  they respond to questions almost immediately  when i bought my first multipack i got a textin coupon with my order for 5 free individual packets  i even received a handwritten note thanking me for supporting their business

in closing there are many reasons why i give surviveware wet wipes a solid 5star rating  my personal reasons are different than most but there are surely many other customers out there who have sbs short gut/short bowel syndrome crohns disease ulcerative colitis irritable bowel syndrome or other gi conditions such as frequent diarrhea as a sideeffect of chemotherapy for cancer etc their quality of life could be significantly improved as mine has been just by reading this review

people dont usually discuss this topic in public usually out of embarrassment  and it might sound silly to healthy folks  but for those who are going through the same medical issues that i have been and always will be dealing withits a really big deal to find a great painrelieving product like this

plus my tweens and teenagers—girls and boys—love this product and will not only use these wipes at home but will actually carry around with them these understated small individual plain black packets to school camp sleepovers camping running sports games and practicesanywhere they go

thank you surviveware  if i could give you 6 stars i would",very good,very good,very good,very good,very good

"i really like that these wipes are totally scentfree and while others have commented that they arent wet or moist enough mine were fine i suspect that those packages were an old lot/inventory and/or werent sealed properly? anyway mine were wet and large enough for mealmost like a disposable version of a rinsed face towel

my biggest complain as others have noted its almost impossible to get the firstor even just onetowel out of the dispenser/pack when you open the sealed flap youre just faced with one flat surface of the towel not an edge or a fold or anything you have to scratch at it with your fingernail or something to hopefully pick/pry the towel out of the openingand then you wind up with a wad of two or even three towels coming out simultaneously as someone else mentioned it seems like they placed the stack of 32 folded towelettes in upside down think about your box of popup facial tissues when you open a fresh box the first tissue has an edge that you can lift out and once you pull that one the next tissue that follows pops up into the openingbut stays in the box

anyway the towelettes themselves are great and what i needa sufficiently wet refreshing wipe that helps me clean up while not near a sink and leaves me feeling refreshed of any skankiness and without any soapy or perfumey residue on my skin

that dispense though woof i suspect the individuallywrapped towelettes they offer would be more convenient but who wants to generate more waste than they have to?",-,very good,-,very good,very good

these napkins are fairly pricey at my local stores even walmart compared to other brands so i was thrilled when i found them on amazon recently on sale as a prime pantry item with a coupon i only bought one pack of the 300count and am now kicking myself for not stocking up although 300 napkins will last awhile in my house ill definitely be keeping an eye out for another deal on amazon",very good,very good,-,-,very good
"see 01/13/2018 revised review below these vanity fair everyday white napkins have a pretty embossed shell pattern and are durable they dont fall apart when wet they are softer than paperyfeeling napkins due to this and to their elegant design they can be used for special occasions in addition to everyday use they arrive in one pack with 150 napkins on each side each napkin is approximately 6 and 1/2 inches by 6 and 1/2 inches i have been using a family dollar store comparable napkin that routinely costs 179 for 100 napkins  this store brand which also remains strong when wet has an embossed floral pattern and is slightly softer it is slightly smaller 6 and 1/2 inches by 6 inches than the vanity fair and is slightly thicker enabling it to stand up better in my napkin holder which is 5 inches tall at its highest point i always have to consider standability because i want to keep my cute napkin holder and napkins falling over in the holder tends to drive my husband crazy  i do note that the shell pattern of the vanity fair napkins is a more elegant design and so is preferred by me for special occasions i would consider these vanity fair everyday napkins to be a fair value at 550 and a good value at 525 or less

revised review of 01/13/2018 due to their elegance and thick soft quality i had been using vanity fair napkins along the side of my decorative holiday plates for guests for many years i opened a new 300 pack for our 01/01/2018 new years day guests and was shocked to discover that the vanity fair  napkins were thin and skimpy by comparison nowhere near the quality of the prior ones it was embarrassing theyre good enough for me to use myself with a sandwich for lunch but thats about it and any brand would do for that purpose i would not consider using these changed ones again to grace my table for guests my original 4 star rating for the prior quality ones is being reduced to a 2 star rating with this current review my plan is to go the nearby store mentioned in my original review and buy a small pack of their floral design napkins if the quality of those are the same as the older vanity fair napkins i will buy several packs to have on hand just in case those become thin/skimpy at some point too i dont plan to purchase vanity fair napkins again",very good,very good,very good,very good,very good

i used it two days in a row for a slow draining kitchen sink it did work so far however i wont buy the packets again because it is dusty when you pour it and it gets in your face  cover the hole if you use it
perhaps the liquid is a better choice",-,very good,-,very good,very good
this does take a bit longer than the 12 hours specified but if you can get it down deep enough and use really hot water it does the job,-,neutral,-,-,neutral
this did help clear out the initial slowing of the drain but you do need to do it once a week easy,-,very good,-,-,very good
"the items consists of three packets of a white crystalline powder you just dump it down a drain let it sit for 30 mins and then flush it with hot water

i find it better as a drain maintenance tool and use a packet in the bathroom sinks to clear out all the hair soap scum and other general build up not sure how well it would work on a super tough clog but it does great if you catch a slow drain early",-,very good,-,-,very good
when our house was built the contractor made the pipe horizontal rather than on a slope so our kitchen drain has the potential to clog easily  we use green gobbler and the drain at our sink now flows well,-,good,-,-,good

"i was at my wits end with a clogged toilet i used an auger a plunger and a toilet sword  with no luck at all an internet search brought me to green gobbler drain clog remover
this stuff worked overnight and i havent had a problem since",-,good,good,-,good
"note it worked after i used all three pockets this is my first time writing a review because this product deserves it it saved me from two weeks of struggling with my clogged kitchen sink in those two weeks i tried other grocery products i also tried baking soda and vinegar/salt and hot water none of them worked
if the sink still doesnt unclog after attempting the first pocket dont give up use the other pockets provided please leave it overnight this is the way this product worked with me after i left it overnightthumbs up",-,good,good,-,good
used to clear water and ice from garage floor,-,good,-,-,good
"i misunderstood the description and thought this was a standard rubberbladed squeegee  instead the blade is thick foam folded into a double layer  i initially planned to return the product but then thought that instead of being wasteful i should test it  i poured water from a clean kitchen pitcher onto the garage floor which had a brandnew polyurea chip coating  i used the squeegee to push the water out of the garage  i am glad i tried it  it worked beautifully for my purpose  it removed all standing water it did not get the garage floor bonedry but that was not my intent  the garage floor was made in 1964 it has high and low spots and the chip coating has a slight texture to prevent slipping  it would be very difficult to get it bonedry  i just wanted to be able to push excess water off the floor and the squeegee did that very well  and it is extremely light in weight i am a very small person so that is a big benefit for me
having decided to keep it i attached the handle  it is a lightweight but sturdy metal handle with a foam end grip  it screws into the blade and then a collar on the blade screws up around the connection  very sturdy  the extension mechanism does not just twist to lock  there is a collar with a tab that locks it  much better imho  i then tried pushing dry leaves off the dry floor  worked great  it did make a slight scrubbing sound on my floor but no annoying squeaking noises  finally i tried pushing wet pine needles off the floor the ultimate test which it did adequately  some pine needles did get stuck in between the halves of the foam blade i simply ran my finger down the center between the two halves of foam and removed the needles easily  i then pushed a little more water with the squeegee and the foam blade came completely clean
i rate this squeegee 5 stars  my sole complaint is that i could not see from the photos what dual foam eva meant  however i am really glad i tested it as it will suit my purpose very well  if you need your floor bonedry i am not sure it will be able to do that and i dont know how well the foam will hold up but the price was extremely reasonable compared to many other squeegees and it has many excellent features",very good,very good,-,-,very good
i really like this product as it works great on my garage epoxy floors out performs more expensive rubber blade squeegees ive purchased i would give it 5 stars if the telescopic pole was a bit longer and sturdier,very good,very good,-,-,very good
works great on carpet to gather pet hair which was clogging my vacuum,-,very good,-,-,very good

i pack my daughter a lunch for school which involves syrup and ketchup sometimes these are perfect to hold those condiments they dont spill the lids stays on tight and there is a lot of them,-,-,good,-,good
i was surprised just how handy these are to have once i got them  and they are great quality the lids go on tight and no leaks,-,good,-,-,good
these are great quality i ordered the pack of 100 i got 83 cups and 80 lids i needed 100 exactly for an event not happy about the shortage but what i got are great quality,-,very good,-,-,very good
"i bought 2 different plastic containers 15 oz sans lids and these 2oz with lids both were great but this review is about the 2 oz with lids
i bought these to replace the small plastic containers i saved from the lemonade mix used in the past  i use these containers for daily medications that i make up 2 weeka in advance these are then place in the individual rubermaid silverware trays that are stacked this way each days meds can be taken out and placed on a counter so i dont forget them we dont have kids around or even company during this pandemic so i can do this

before i purchased this i read the reviews first to see if the lids would even work and was a bit hesitant but i had no problem at all these were filled with gummie vitamins and gummie calcium and some with the lids attached were accidently dropped on the floor and the lids remained on i realized that since they had lids i could make up weeks at a time for the gummie vitamins and calcium gummies that we take its much more efficent to do it a month or more at a time than a week at a time

i am definately going to reorder this products as i dont expect they will last forever i am very pleased with this product as it fills the need they were bought for",-,very good,very good,very good,very good

"i bought a leather recliner from an upscale furniture store off there clearance its a beautiful color and soft the reason it was on mark down was it had lots of scratches and damage to the leather i negotiate it on a better price and while i was waiting for them to load it up i jumped on amazon because it needed cpr leather cleaner and conditioner
all you need to do is apply it to a sponge rub it in and take a micro cloth or a chamois and wipe it away it looks like a brand new chair my husband was amazed  of course and all the scratches and imperfections are gone
this is not an overhyped or an over eager review its so good i recently bought another bottle to give to a friend with ivory leather furniture",very good,very good,-,very good,very good
i have red leather jacket that i absolutely love we had a house fire and while she didnt get burned directly she had a lot of smoke damage the outside of my jacket was black from the soot and i couldnt find a dry cleaner willing to try i ordered this and not only did it work to get all the black off but she no longer smells of smoke so happy to have my favorite jacket back,-,very good,-,-,very good
of all the leather cleaners i have used through the years for all my daughters horse products from boots to saddles to reins leather cpr is by far the easiest to use as well as the best in my opinion highly recommend,-,very good,-,-,very good
used this on some 5 old leather chairs and the results were amazing use the glove to apply like the video suggests and it is an amazing difference,-,very good,-,-,very good
been using this product for years its great prefer the larger format great seller,-,-,-,-,-
useful for conditioning older leather pieces  brought out color,-,good,-,-,good
used it to restore a leather chair inadvertently scratched by a small dog when leaping up to sit  filled in scratches and restored color perfectly with no dyes and no stickiness or residue or any kind wonderful product,-,very good,-,-,very good
overall i love the squeeze bottle and that it is a crème vs balm goes on really easily i feel it did a pretty good job of cleaning but did not make the leather as supple as some other cleaner/conditioners i have used,-,very good,-,very good,very good
i have been using all free for many years  will not use any other laundry detergent i have many allergies  all free does not set them off,-,very good,-,-,very good
i love this detergent so easy to use just throw one to two packets depending on the size of the load in with your clothes i especially like that theres no dyes or fragrances in this detergent that way i dont have a laundry fragrance competing with my perfume,-,very good,-,-,very good
performs as advertised,-,-,-,-,-
i previously used dreft for my sons laundry and switched over to this his eczema is so much better after switching to free and clear if your child has sensitive skin this is the way to go,-,very good,-,-,very good
i am not a laundry guy these are simple no mess and easy to store great invention for even a single guy,-,-,-,-,-
my sons break out at the smallest sign of fragrance so i was glad to find laundry pods that are not breaking my pocket we have used this liquid detergent for about 4 years and started to see a decline in the stores so finding this specific one has been helpful no itchy skin and having an occasional bed wetter also no urine odor after washing with these we dont use all the pods as quickly as we used the liquid detergent so i would say for the price its a great value if you have a pretty big family or just wash quite a bit of clothes and dont like fragrance detergent this is the best buy for your buck also your skin will thank you,very good,very good,-,-,very good
great laundry detergent for sensitive skin and cleans clothes well,-,-,-,-,-
great deal and worth it,-,-,-,-,-
the chemex sometimes gets a bad reputation from some coffee enthusiasts but the filters are of great quality with next to no paper flavor when rinsed they can be modified to ensure even water flow and to minimize the possibility of a stalled brew,-,very good,very good,-,very good
the circle shape on chemex filters is easier to use than the square and these white ones are sturdier than the brown,-,good,-,-,good
son incomparables,-,-,-,-,-
fast delivery no issues works like a charm in my chemex,-,good,good,-,good
"i dont have a chemex brewer but i do use a krups moka brew the filters for the krups are expensive and difficult to find so i tested these chemex filters to see how they would perform a square chemex filter is 12 x 12 which means that i can cut out 9 krupssized filters out of each one a box of 100 krups filters costs 7 to 10 bucks for about the same price i get 900 from the chemex the chemex filters are also thicker than the krups filters  id say about 20

ive been using the krups moka brew for several years and love the coffee it makes and you can even do an abbreviated brew to make something that resembles espresso  i ran several backtoback brews comparing the performance of the krups filter vs the chemex filter on my moka brew i used 20 grams of the same home roasted coffee with 500ml of water for each brew and a capresso infinity grinder skip to the conclusion if you just want the results

a krups filter i used only one filter and tamped down with a moderate amount of force the beans were ground on the finest fine setting 5 this is how i usually do it on the moka brew from the time the water hits the coffee it took 3m50s for the brewing to complete initially there was the characteristic delicious looking thick drip with the dense crema  it looks close to espresso with a bit of the mouse tailing sometimes i stop the brew at about 30 seconds and just drink that its close to espresso and very delicious the complete brew had a lot of body with robust flavor like a great americano

b one chemex filter i ground the beans and tamped them like with the krups filter i was shocked to see how fast the water came through it was a waterfall compared to the rich stream from the krups filter the brewing time was only 2m20s there was none of that rich dense crema at the initial stages and the resulting coffee tasted more like a drip brew it had thinner body vs the krups filter and the flavor was cleaner its still a decent cup of coffee but i was surprised at the amount of difference the filter made

c two chemex filters i decided to use two filters one on top and one on the bottom i also changed the grind setting to 3 notches finer 2 i tamped it pretty hard the brewtime for this was comparable to using one krups filter  3m45s however the brew still looked different vs the krups while it was no longer the waterfall that it was with just one chemex filter and the drip rate was similar to that of the krups filter the characteristics were still very different mainly it still lacked that rich looking initial brew stage that you get with the krups filter the body was thicker vs using one filter but still slightly thinner than with the krups filter

conclusion the krups filter makes a huge difference versus using the chemex filter despite being thicker the chemex filter results in a faster brew with less body and a cleaner cup profile the chemex results are still good but closer to a normal drip brew rather than a moka/americano quality one gets with a krups filter i recommend using a finer grind with the chemex filter and using two or more? filters  at least when brewing less than a full pot the chemex filters will still be cheaper since theyre roughly 1/7 the price of a krups filter i cant say that one result is better than the other  its a matter of preference i prefer a fuller body and an occasional espresso from the moka brew so ill still get the krups filters despite the high price however the chemex filter is an option when the krups filters are unavailable as often happens the chemex might also result in better coffee for beans that are brighter and lightly roasted  worth testing",very good,very good,very good,very good,very good
ive been buying chemex filters for years my recent order was such a disappointmenta new package that doesnt fit in my cupboard filters were unfolded  theyve always been folded in the past the paper was so thin whats happened? plus the coffee tastes terrible now very bitter not the usual nice flavor ill have to search for an alternative filter now these are unacceptable,-,-,-,bad,bad
great for what i needed,-,-,-,-,-
ive tried using multiple other filters because these are a little spendy but have realized they are 100 worth it ive never had one break wether thats while making the coffee or carry the filter to the garbage to throw it away creates a perfect flow for the water to get all the flavor out of your favorite bean so you can enjoy that beautiful cup of coffee ill never buy another brand,-,-,-,-,-
we love these paper napkins  ive always used colored hand towels in my 3rd bathroom to dry your hands after washing  then it started to bother me when i went back into that bathroom the towel was still damp and there i was using it again  didnt like it anymore  so i bought a paper napkin holder for the vanity top and these fit perfectly  also trust me on this  cut the napkins in half  i used a whole one the first time and it was such a waste  you dont come close to using it all they dont tear at all so there is no need for a full one  very easy to cut in half without unfolding them  you double your napkins and that half works great to dry your hands  i will always buy these  well worth it  5 star purchase,-,very good,very good,-,very good
i mostly use these as hand towels in the bath  while they are not as soft as previous ones used they are a much better quality than ones previously used those were all right initially but got thinner and started tearing while in use  i replaced them with these and have been very happy with them,-,very good,-,-,very good

"i recently picked up the casabella storage caddy for my apartment and i have to say im really impressed with it as a young guy living in a small apartment i dont have a lot of space to store cleaning products and supplies so i needed something that was compact and easy to tote around this caddy fits the bill perfectly

the translucent gray color is a nice touch because it makes it easy to see whats inside the caddy without having to dig through a pile of cleaning supplies the orange handle adds a pop of color to the design and makes it easy to carry the caddy around even when its fully loaded i also appreciate how comfortable the handle is to hold even when carrying it for longer distances

one of the things i really love about this caddy is how sturdy and durable it is its made from highquality materials that can withstand frequent use which is great for me since i tend to use my cleaning supplies pretty often the caddys patented design allows it to nest on top of casabellas 185gallon bucket which is a nice feature that makes it easy to store and transport around my apartment

overall i think the casabella storage caddy is a great investment for anyone who wants a practical and reliable storage solution for their cleaning products and supplies whether youre a young guy living in a small apartment like me or someone with a larger home or office this caddy is definitely worth considering its durable compact and easy to use and im really happy with my purchase",-,very good,-,very good,very good

im a chemist and i learned long ago that saran wrap is superior to any other food wrap  volatile organic compounds and other molecules cannot penetrate through saran wrap  if you wrap any food that has a detectable odor in saran wrap and then sniff it you cant smell it  try that with any other food wrap  if you can smell the food through the wrap your nose is detecting trace organic compounds in the air  that means the juices of your food are evaporating right out of the wrap  thats why saran wrap keeps food fresher longer,-,good,-,-,good

"my first purchase was via publix but for which no longer carried the brand and only uncovered this when i had just enough left for 2 loads of laundry  good ole faithful amazon prevented a laundry catastrophe and delivered in record time  i have very sensitive skin and eczema with many of the products i used for years now causing severe itching  my original purchase decision came after reading and researching the contents label  googling the reviews due to my skin condition
since the product is concentrated i need only a capful for a medium load and add a sprinkle of their scent booster  this leaves my laundry clean and leaves both my laundry  home with a very pleasant aromatic scent  guests always asks me if the scent is from my plugins and when i reveal the source they are usually amazed
have been and will continue to recommend this product which not only does a phenomenal job and smells divine but is also delicate and causes no skin irritations plus the cost factor compared to other laundry detergents is a great return on my investment in this product",very good,very good,very good,very good,very good
it does its job i love that its in a smaller container and only a small amount is needed space saver it also is very runny so it makes pouring it much neater what i dont like is the smell nothing like a beach more like a manly outdoorsy smell my family doesnt mind it but the smell just isnt what i like it,-,poor,-,poor,poor
when we decided we needed to buy a new washing machine because ours was old moldy top load so no way to clean it expensive to run 400 yearly and not efficient nor large enough to even run a full weeks worth of clothes 34 cubic feet we knew we would need a he detergent i had been eyeing this for a while but hadnt spent the money but now that we needed detergent that would work with our new machine front load whirlpool 50 cubic feet and energy star efficient which is more efficient then he machines i grabbed this i have done 5 loads with this and i have found that it works well clothes come out clean smelling very faint after wash but smells almost like dawn dish soap which i dont mind and stains including a dirt/oil stain on my knees in a autoshop that came from moving a lift arm came out off of the white pants i was wearing even without pretreatment or soaking this detergent works quite well for the purpose it is meant to serve and the lines on the lid are exactly 2 tablespoons or 30 ml which is the max detergent you want to use in an he machine this detergent has basically no suds and the machine hasnt had any problems using it nonhe detergents get to sudsy and cause leaking and errors in washing machines i overall recommend this detergent,very good,very good,-,-,very good

this is an ok mop bucket and works better than my old one with a broken wringer its very substantial and rolls great unfortunately i employ a dozen teenagers 1416 and this mop bucket does not have the little round “cut out” like the name brand does thus as my staff leaves the mop in the bucket after cleaning a spill the mop falls out annoying since i worry about employees tripping over the mop if it had the “cut out” for the mop i would have given it 5 stars,-,good,-,-,good
"these are a bit thin as others have mentioned but theyre large enough to fold over for double thickness theyre also quite soft and nonirritating i read one or two reviews about them being dried out but the ones i got are plenty moist without being drippingwet as others have noted theyre a little tough to get started out of the pack but if you look under the edge of the lid and find the beginning edge of the wipe its a lot easier note to the manufacturer it would be nice if you folded them so the edge lands in the middle of the opening after that they pull out accordionstyle so you dont have to dig beyond the first one

and finally the price is decent i hate paying extra for equivalent products just because theyre being marketed to women  the dreaded pink tax since these are unscented theres nothing for women not to like",bad,-,-,-,bad
dont smell are a good size nice and moist cool respectable packaging smiling face with sunglasses they get the job done at work where you dont have time to do a a normal  lengthy bathroom routine like any wipe  watch how you pinch em to pull out of pack you may snag 3 or more then start pulling too many out  other than that i highly recommend a few of these in you home car etc,-,very good,very good,very good,very good

"i am very pleased with this product  however the instructions were written by someone in the 3rd grade  also the functionality can be a little confusing at first especially if trying to figure operation on your own without instructions  despite these shortcomings i am so impressed with what i liked about the product i still gave it 5 stars  here is what i liked about this item

1 the paddle is flat   maybe i am not that skilled but i cant make my bug kills in the air  i usually wait to the flying pest lands on a flat surface and then go for the kill  with a flat paddle you can cover the entire service entrapping your intended victim without an escape route due to a nonflat paddle  i found other swatters did not have this and bugs could get away

2  strong zap  you get an instant kill

3  the rotating paddle head is nice when you want to switch between modes

4 no batteries to replace

as a public service i would like to explain its operation  this product has two distinct modes  1 a wired bug zapper 2 a electrified fly swatter

there is a side switch that goes in three positions i call this the mode selector switch

mode 1  the switch is in the topmost position closest to the electrified paddle  this is used for the wired bug zapper mode  to use this mode the power cable must be plugged in  when in this mode and only after the item is plugged in you must press the round push button switch at the bottom of the swatter eg furthest away from the paddle to turn on  i guess the middle position alone wasnt good enough so another button was neededkinda dumb

once turned on these pretty purple led lights come on and attract the mosquitos/files  behind the top of the paddle on the top of the handle there is a plastic loop which you can use to hang the unit to the wall  i just put a simple nail in the wall and hang it that way  very nice feature and shows they were thinking on this one

mode 2  the switch is in the middle position  this is the electrified bug swatter mode  in this use it works off the charged battery  to use you simply press and hold the oblong button above the mode selector switch  this activates the wire mesh  you must press and hold this for as long as you are going after the target bug  when doing so the small lightening bolt illuminates in the front  seemingly useless there is a white led that stays and remains illuminated on when in this mode  i see no benefit to this light whatsoever

mode 3  switch is in lowest position furthest away from the paddle  this is the useless mode  neither mode 1 or mode 2 work and there is no functionality available when in this mode  the only purpose i can figure is this was an attempt to make the unit somewhat child safe",-,bad,-,bad,bad
ive had three other types of these bug rackets and this is the best one yet by a long way light yet sturdy and way powerful  and the onoff switch is the kicker  i can stick it in a pocket and have no concern of surprises,-,very good,-,-,very good

these gloves are pretty long they cover the expanse of your arm i also have some questions about the durability of them as they seem pretty thin in material so much so that you can feel the heat from hot water pretty clearly  as if there is no protection at all on your hands i use these for washing dishes to get my hands not from pruning up and it suffices in that regard but i am not super pleased with them,-,poor,-,poor,poor

"this might seem like nit picking but these batteries dont mark the positive or negative side of the battery psits the flat side not the side with the little button this is not a big deal but it is irritating i had to put the batteries in the device twice a digital air pressure gauge and the gauge display would not light up it was kind of a pain to put the batteries in and then take them out because i had to use needle nose pliers to remove them finally i had to find another button battery that did have the plus and minus sides marked so i knew i was putting the battery in correctly the display still did not light up on my air pressure guage so i thought maybe it was damaged but it was practically brand new so i went to try to use it and then it worked because it only comes on when air pressure was put through it so while marking the battery sides seems like an inconsequential issue it can waste your valuable time skoanbe needs to do better

its pretty handy for washing the bathroom this keeps you a little further away from work and saves you the hassle of scrubbing tiles or the bathroom as well as not breathing in the detergent so close i have also used it when i needed to rub down some plastic boxes that i decided to move from the garage to the house i see it can work for cleaning garden furniture in the spring to rub it liberally with detergent and then hose it down after storing it in the garage or outside the brush at the end is quite maneuverable the iron cue is durable and adjustable in length i am satisfied with the purchase,-,very good,-,very good,very good

"i like this product it prevents me from having to break my back to clean the tub which was the purpose of the buy however i do still feel the need to scrub a bit harder — so instead of back pain comes shoulder and arm pain lol

i thought buying this i would make my routine easier i still follow my same routine — this i just added to it as a second / finishing scrub after the tough scrub

i wouldnt say its the easiest to clean all sponges gross me out after use lol but after all it is a sponge

its pretty sturdy ive set it against the wall and its fell a handful of times and it hasnt broke",-,very good,very good,-,very good
"this extendable brush is perfect for scrubbing the shower i am very short and the tile around my tub goes to the ceiling cleaning the tub is difficult because i cant reach very high i also have trouble scrubbing with just a nonscratch sponge
this has been a life saver i can easily reach all corners of the tub with the extendable pole that locks tightly into place the head with the bristles moves around to get in the corners and the crevices under the faucet and around the handles it also helps to easily clean the builtin shelves in the shower the bristles are soft enough that they dont scratch or damage the tub or the tub surround but strong enough that they affectively clean and remove soap scum and hard water stains
this has been a big help to me it has cut the time it takes me to clean the shower in half i highly recommend this",-,very good,very good,-,very good
"just got this havent even tried cleaning with it yet and im already knocking off a couple stars for this badly engineered thing  like a lot of other reviewers i initially couldnt get this thing to lock into place after extending i would extend twist and twist nothing happened the first time i got it working was like finding gold

heres how im able to do it now consistently because thats key  in the heat of the moment of fighting the dreaded mildew who wants to interrupt being in the zone to spend hours twisting this thing

1  collapse it handle goes all the way down towards the head until you cant go any further
2  hold the head/front pole the end where the scrubber is twist the bottom pole to the right like youre using a screwdriver to screw in a screw tighten it until it doesnt go any further and you cant extend the bottom pole dont go nuts though  not so tight that you wont be able to untwist it
3  while still holding onto the scrubber side of the pole now untwist the bottom pole but only a little  maybe one or two rotations  just enough to start extending the bottom pole while still feeling some resistance/friction/tightness/rubbing against the poles while extending
4  extend the pole to your desired length you dont even need extend all the way and lock it into place by twisting the bottom pole towards the right again

im convinced that theres some kind of shaft inside that needs to be pulled with the bottom pole when extending  if you extend it and you dont catch that internal piece with it youre screwing nothing and it will never catch i could be extremely wrong though  dont  me on twitter

if you still dont get it  watch the nice lady on the oxo instructional video  notice how she starts with it collapsed then only does a very small twist to unlock extend and twist to lock again  shame on oxo for making this difficult though its not very intuitive at all  an external button/catch/spring whatever would be so much better

lets hope it scrubs well if not ill be back to knock off more stars ",-,very good,very good,-,very good
this is actually my second purchase of this scrub brush i love how easy it is to clean my tub/shower it definitely makes cleaning the bathroom a lot easier especially that i have carpal tunnel in both my wrist i dont have to apply much pressure to get the shower scum off so thats a plus,-,very good,-,-,very good
yes its a bit small but the telescoping arm and the heads ability to pick up dust and long strands of cobwebsjust spin it makes it more than capable if anything works better when wet but as it becomes dirty it can mark up surfaces when wet so either use it dry or clean it more often than i do it does clean relatively easily but when totally loaded it took me 5 minutes in a soap water bath and under a sprayer working out all the little bits to get it completely clean look it can either grab stuff easily or let go of it easily not both im happy with the former and how small it packs down and the fact that it comes with a backup head/cover is even betterthough i cant imagine needing a backup anytime soon definitely an upgrade over my old plastic fauxfeather duster or i wouldnt bother writing this just like i dont usually bother to dust nice to have a tool that can handle the job once i finally get around to it,-,very good,very good,very good,very good

"the product was shipped and deliverred promptly and is exactly the type that is acceptable for use in california  the handle ties are really handy  and were the main reason i chose this product  and make it very easy to tie up the bag of food waste before disposing of it  the bag is a little bigger than the simple human detachable compost bin i use but again its easy to tie the handles a bit then stretch it onto the liner in the compost bin and all fits very neatly

i really like their dispenser box  its sturdy  the slit for dispensing a bag is convenient and well placed  and each bag is perforated at the bottom and already mostly separated so dispensing a bag and detaching it from the next bag is very easy  good design overall in my opinion

after food waste has been in the bag for a day or two  or four  there does seem to be some leakage but i think its actually more that the bag has already started to decompose and its not really leaking  reminder to self  empty the food waste more often

highly recommended",-,very good,-,very good,very good
i have tried other bags but these are the perfect ones at least for me they are durable so they dont break easily and the best part are the handles that i can tie to close the bag it makes it so easy for me to put all my food waste in i love that our trash company started accepting food waste so i feel like im actually doing something good,-,very good,-,-,very good
"strong yet light and thin  most likely a very hard combination of attributes to perfect and get right every production batch yet havent had a bad superbio bag yet

very much pleased with the superbio 26 g bags  pefect smallish size for so many things  wife uses them for kitty litter duties  i use em to workshop/desktop bags 3d printing waste etc  perfect size and sturdiness for so many random things

while a bit on the expensive side you do get the value of what you are paying for  which can not be said for alot of other products

we do enjoy the handy dispense box although the bags do tend to stick to each other tightly when pulling up a new bag  so there is no one handed pull type of dispense  you need two hands for sure  one to steady the new/old bag and one to tear them apart  never any odd tears however  always tear along the perforation between the bags

no idea if these are really bio friendly  they are wife and 3d printer friendly  so they are me friendly",very good,very good,-,very good,very good
these bags arent so prone to leaking as other bags i have used in fact they dont leak at all unless i leav e the compost marinating in them too full for too long the best feature is the handles they make it so much easier to carry without spilling than lesser bags i have used also the bags are sufficiently deep that i dont experience them slouching down into the container and spill as i have with other bags great product i use them exclusively,-,very good,-,very good,very good
i love being green and wish these were less expensive as i use a lot for kitty litter waste  not quite as big as a typical grocery sack but did well for my purposes  easy to dispense and strong,very good,very good,-,-,very good

"i bought this in december 2022 and immediately put it to use on the army of gnats i had in my house it worked great from day one i moved it around the house every few days for two weeks when suddenly i heard a pop and smelled burning rubber i followed the smell and realized it was the zapper i messaged the company and explained what happened i spoke to their customer service on the phone and a very nice polite gentleman told me the bulb blew he took my address and sent me a new unit i immediately put it into use and almost two months later its still working perfectly

the reason i gave it 4 stars out of 5 is only because i feel there are some limitations with the unit

con
 1 it doesnt have an on/off switch and must be unplugged to turn it off
 2 the power cord is relatively short so you are forced to keep it near an outlet
 3 the bug tray on both my units was difficult to unlock and remove and difficult to replace and lock

i spoke to the customer service rep about the on/off switch and he did thank me for my suggestion and told me he would channel it on to the correct department i appreciated that

pro
 1 it does what it says it does zap bugs there were tons of gnats in the tray
 2 customer service is excellent they resolve problems quickly without pushback

"update 2  i received the replacement bulb and although there were no instructions on how to replace it i was able to do so with a little trial and error  the zapper is shining brightly and is once again back on heavy duty  within a few minutes i received an audio confirmation of its effectiveness  kudos to livin well for their great customer service  sending a replacement bulb gratis to make good on their advertised longevity was above and beyond what i expect these days  i raised my rating a star to five stars accordingly
update  i received an email response from the livin well team informing me that they have replacement bulbs but theyre not sold on amazon  however they offered to mail me a replacement if i sent them my address  i did so and they responded again with a confirmation  ill update again if and when i receive the replacement bulb  this almost sounds too good to be true but if they come through i certainly feel that this product and customer service will warrant an upgrade to five stars
i was so impressed with this bug zapper that i purchased a second one the following month  my primary objective was to add another layer of protection against mosquitoes when im out on covered patio working on my plants and vegetable garden  i already use dunks/natural soap in my water pots/buckets have a large shop fan blowing across the patio and light up a coil between the fan and my patio sliding door  during the summer down here in south florida i really need defense in depth since im out there for several hours every day  i ordered the second one to use inside our house since bugs always seem to sneak in when i open the sliding door to get in and out

i know that scientifically uv light doesnt necessarily attract mosquitoes but these zappers sure offed a great number of them even if it was just by chance  my wife who is very susceptible to mosquito bites they really swell badly frequently tries to swat them in the house with our tennis racket zapper when she sees one  shes rarely successful and is convinced that they flee and avoid her when she picks up the racket zapper  several minutes after she gives up and sits back down we hear the livin well bug zapper sitting on a kitchen counter sizzling away  while theres no guarantee that it was the mosquito that she was chasing we never see it again  they also zapped a slew of other flying bugs many that i couldnt even identify  my wife and i were truly amazed at the number of bugs that were in the house  one con that we noticed is that not only do many of the zapped bugs not fall into the removable tray nor get caught/burned into the mesh many seem to get thrown out of the trap altogether as evidenced by the many bug carcasses lying around the perimeter of the zapper

the six foot long cord is a big plus since it greatly expands placement/deployment of the zapper  many competitors only have a four foot cord a complaint written by numerous reviewers  the cord is also thick and sturdy giving me peace of mind especially for the one used outside  the metal hanging ring on top is sturdy enough double rings and is an inch in diameter but the plastic nob that its mounted on blocks half the ring making it a little difficult to hang on thicker hooks

i would have given this five stars but knocked on off because the bulb on the first one i purchased just went out after 5760 hours and didnt last the 8000 hours in the product description  we leave both of them plugged in 24/7  i contacted the seller for information on replacement bulbs because theres no listing for them on amazon and am waiting for a response  it may be more cost effective to buy a new zapper and if so thats what ill do  im willing to pay this price for eight months of added protection",very good,very good,very good,very good,very good
their customer service staff is awesome i had questions about my bug zappers not only did they help me troubleshoot the problem they were kind enough to make it right and send me a replacement i would recommend this product,-,very good,-,-,very good

at first i thought they didnt work because no noise but they are covering the grill in great dead numbers i havent noticed any moths just mosquitos and gnats i havent emptied the tray yet because i clean the grill with canned air daily until the tray is obviously full the last model caught moths june bugs and beetles in large numbers but i dont really want to bother them just the mosquitoes and gnats so that would be an improvement along with the lack of sizzle its early so well see how it works going forward and report changes,-,very good,-,very good,very good

i have some biiiiig windows one of which i look through every morning while im drinking my coffee to see my garden in the skies and the birdfeeder during the winter however my window gets very dirty so i was determined to clean it myself ive always just used newsprint and spray glass cleaner but this is a big window i purchased this squeegee kit watched a short video from this old house on how to clean glass with a squeegee and was stunned and surprised at how fast and easy my windows were to clean i can see my yard again,-,very good,-,-,very good
no comments,-,-,-,-,-
this purchase was to take the place of my previous window cleaning routine and it does a pretty great job ill start by saying that ive got a large living room window and its become increasingly difficult to clean the exterior with my ladder call it old age if you want but ive been dangerously close to falling into a sharp bush and/or a bird bath since thats not how i wanted to go i began searching for alternatives and found this gem i also purchased window cleaner and a rectangular bucket and i love it the long handle seems sturdy enough for what i need and i can easily reach all areas of my window from the ground it goes together easily and you can start using it right away the first time i used it i ended up cleaning it twice but that was more because i tried cleaning while the hot afternoon sun was shining on it and it dried before i could do the squeegee magic yes i said ‘magic that was a user error and nothing to do with the product though in fact the directions tell you not to do that but i was too excited and couldnt wait my only complaint is that i really wish this would have come with two handles the reason why is because you constantly have to switch between the cleaning end and the squeegee end and i mean you better be fast or the wash will dry and then youve got to do it all over again i mustve looked like i was on a game show because i was washing one minute and then flying over to grab the squeegee unscrewing one end and screwing in the other then running back to get that magical streakfree shine ill probably end up buying a second one but then you could argue that its not the best value for the money and thats why this isnt the 5star review i wish it could be,very good,very good,very good,-,very good

"wow where have these been all my life? seriously to voluntarily gush over lint rollers must say something about my life but these are the bomb

yes they are sticky and pick up hair much better than the typical lint rollers ive purchased at the supermarket or home goods but the thing that makes me so thrilled is how easily they peel to reveal the next layer i have honestly battled the last several rolls ive purchased some as refills and some as brand new roller sets that refuse to detach each used piece or take several layers with it or require the most deft fingernail picking and peeling and then they still shred into slivered layers my frustration level with these things is through the roof

and to make it worse my son has a collegiate gym shirt that he loves  wears weekly that has an almost magnetic appeal for every piece of lint and cat hair and fuzz in its path it actually seems like lint weaves into the knit this shirt alone has demanded large swaths of sheets from previous rollers and i got so tired of the picknpeel process that i would usually just pull off several long strips of 510 squares at a time to clean up this shirt with the konizy i was able to roll it perfectly free of all lint  hair on both sides  with just 3 squares

in the pictures posted i showed one side took two pieces of the konizy and there was some stick left on the back of the shirt which was as bad as the front i used my old roller you can see it took 8 pieces they tore and had to be hand stuck and unstuck to get the back the same as the front

this works im glad i bought a multipack based on previous reviews they did not exaggerate",-,very good,very good,-,very good

you know i bought this dinnerware because im hosting an event and i have just been searching everywhere for dinnerware that is beautiful and elegant so many things look like those cheap paper plates with ugly patterns this is definitely much prettier than anything else that ive looked at i love the rose gold its more modern and chic  also i wanted something that was sturdy and functional ive seen some plates that when you stack them full of food they get soggy and crumple under the weight or they break if they are made out of really thin cheap plastic but these plates are actually fairly sturdy i was surprised who knew? i think they will hold up well during the event i really liked that the straws are actually paper straws so much better for the environment and everything is coordinated with that beautiful rose gold color but its not too matchymatchy the dinner plates dessert plates and the cups have thin stripes then the straws have thicker swirly stripe but the napkins they have these cute little polka dots and its not all over in a uniform pattern but its like somebody threw confetti randomly all over the place and some of it got on the napkins which i think makes it look so much more cuter i placed the confetti area on the outside of the plate with the utensils on top of  them and it looked sooo cute the cups are the perfect size for a ladle of punch and i like that they are clear because there is going to be so much stuff on the table and when you get too much on the table  everything starts to look cluttered  with the glasses being clear it actually cuts down on the visual clutter of the table and bonus  they reflect light  beautifully you know i couldnt believe that this actually comes with these little teeny tiny forks that just puts the cherry on top of the sunday the utensils are already beautiful because they look like theyre real rose gold utensils even though theyre just plastic then to have the cute little forks that match perfectly overthetop cute  i really recommend these  they do not disappoint me in the least everything is impeccably elegant and i couldnt be happier with my choice,very good,very good,-,-,very good

regular tide does a great job removing stains and leaving your laundry clean but i find the fragrance of regular tide overpowering and it also sometimes over a long period of use can cause me to break out in a rash this variation of tide cleans just as thoroughly but i dont find the scent too strong and its never caused my skin to feel the least bit irritated i much prefer using this variation of the product and enthusiastically endorse it,-,very good,very good,-,very good

when i saw this product i felt like i needed it because of the build up of lint inside of my dryers lint trap safe to say i was wrong there were 4 small screws that i never noticed before that i removed to get deeper into the lint trap compartment i wouldve never noticed them had the item been able to get down in the crevices like i feel its intended to be used for you can merely save money and use the attachments that come with your vacuum after removing the trap of course and that is the picture that i posted i gave it 4 stars because it does work and the brush is the best thing in the package but im kind of cheap and felt like i couldve saved that 12 and spent it elsewhere down the amazon wormhole,very good,very good,-,very good,very good

no leaks even if liquid stays in the cup for more than 24 hours the lid fits perfectly,-,-,-,-,-
"i love these and use them every day they work perfectly for our coffee on the go i have been buying and using these cups for years now

out of curiosity i looked at what others were posting in all the years i have been buying these cups
1 yes i have had a few lids crack but somehow i always have more lids than cups anyway
2 i have never had one leak although they have a look that they might with extended or multiple uses in other words having liquid in them for extended periods i have had coffee in them for up to 23 hours max
3 i have always gotten gray lids i am unsure why anyone would make a big stink over the lids being gray and not black its a togo coffee cup drink it and toss it and move on
4 some photos show dented lids yeah smashed ill give you but some were just a little smashed and will go on the cup

so in a nutshell great cups with an occasional problem that really isnt worth mentioning considering how often you get it right if you get damaged ones send them back no need to leave a bad review amazon has the easiest return policies",-,bad,bad,-,bad

i got lazy at some point and started buying disposable coffee cups so i could have one less item to wash every day these hold up all day and they come with the lids they are insulated enough so you can hold them with hot coffee in them most importantly is that they are sturdy and ive never had any issues with the bottom of the cup giving out like a ton of the generic cups available on amazon for great prices i have a full box of generic cups 85 cups16 ounces that i cant use since discovering how dangerous they can be when the bottom gives out i hope they are no longer making them but i wont consider the generic ones anymore for that reason its worth paying more if youre buying disposable coffee cups so you or a guest doesnt get burned,very good,very good,-,very good,very good
theyre fairly sturdy and are the best disposable cups i have used regarding the lid staying on during use  so many different cups have problems with the lid popping off when you pick it up  these stay in place and hold up because i havent had any of them leak  its a disposable cup  so it doesnt keep it very warm past 30 minutes  i prefer these cups to other brands i have used,-,good,-,-,good
these are not 12 oz cups more like 10 when you hold the cup the slightest pressure indents the cup and where the seam is leaks through with the lid on overall i am not impressed with the cups but cost wise if you have them for an office and go through them quickly which is what i bought them for you are not getting a bad deal,very good,-,very good,-,very good

these were cheap cost wise but unfortunately quality wise too if you dont make sure to store it upright all the soap will leak out the hole in the edge of the head a couple if times ive refilled the handle with soap at night and the next morning the scrubber will be lying in the sink with all the soap leaked out also the pads fall off really easily  i can get them to last maybe 2 weeks if i microwave the head in water and vinegar every few days to keep it clean but usually the pad falls off before then,poor,poor,poor,-,poor

"i have been using soapdispensing dish scrubbers for over five quarters of a dozen years in that time i have witnessed a number of advancements in the field and have tried all of them i have found that the best you can hope for is a wand that is mildly reliable will last you for a year or more and that has easytofind replacement heads cost of course is also important scotchbrite tends to fit these requirements that is why i was willing to commit to buying this pack of fourteen heads

these days we have a dishwasher so we only use the dish scrubber for the larger pots and pans as well as the items the dishwasher fails to clean up to my standards and the dish scrubber heads get the job done i have noticed though that after a respectable amount of time they do develop leaks that cause tens of cents worth of dishwasher fluid to literally go down the drain so be wary of this

also be very strict with your family when it comes to where they store the wand i have a very careless exgirlfriend and stepson who put it in nasty chili water or ice cream water and leave it there that will give it the stank that will dominate your kitchen and plague everything it touches this is not the fault of the product it is the fault of irresponsible family members raised in suboptimal situations i cannot stress enough that you should only spend your time with people who have refined tastes you can start your search by checking out what soapdispensing dish scrubbers they are rocking in their kitchen if they have scotchbrite or even oxo they are a keeper

update if you are prone to ironic disasters never buy in large quantities like this you are just setting yourself up to die or lose both of your hands in the next couple days stick with buying one twopack",good,good,good,-,good

these gloves are pretty long they cover the expanse of your arm i also have some questions about the durability of them as they seem pretty thin in material so much so that you can feel the heat from hot water pretty clearly  as if there is no protection at all on your hands i use these for washing dishes to get my hands not from pruning up and it suffices in that regard but i am not super pleased with them,-,poor,-,poor,poor

"i house many tropical plants thru the winter in dedicated rooms with grow lights each year bugs are a large problem a few months into the indoor season i have used neem oil sticky strips etc with very very limited success i simply needed something more robust that would work on a larger scale

this zapper is just the ticket it attracts the gnats that are the prevailing problem within a week the bug problem is virtually nonexistent and very well controlled i leave it on 24/7 in a room not occupied at night or by pets every night once the other lights are out it takes care of the bugs that have hatched that day

it is very loud and will startle you the first time you are close to it it would not be good around pets or at night for most people trying to sleep also even though the cleaning tray is decent and easy to work with there is a lot of debris on the floor underneath it has however made my plant collection enjoyable once again and the bug problem is virtually maintenance free

so we tried this

it has a nice satisfying crack to it and the moths flock to it  the only problem i have is the grates are almost too close together  moths get sick often and roast which is a awful smell  i am hoping this will work on houseflys once summer brings those pesky creatures on

we hung ours on a flat wall with a trash can below that work nicely  we have definitely seen a reduction in our room after hanging this in the hallway

"purchased two of these after researching all kinds of mosquito control products and options  so my review is all about mosquito control  if that doesnt interest you you may not find this information useful

first ill include information about this product  skip to the end to read other options i considered and why this product was a winner  i know its not directly a review of this product but sometimes one item is the best because of limitations or shortcomings with other solutions  i felt it important to outline those as i spent a lot of time collecting and analyzing the data  maybe it will save someone else from spending their time on it

first impressions
opening the box the product was very simple and fully assembled  bulbs installed and all which was great  you get exactly what you see in the pictures  the unit with a metal hanging loop up top plus some documentation  take time to read the instructions  what ive found from all my research is that catching or killing mosquitoes has a fair number of subtle tricks  so dont just run a cord plug this thing in and expect magic  height above the ground location relative to the common wind patters locating it in front of or behind something that blocks the wind visibility the bugs gotta see the light to be attracted to it and more are all factors you should learn about  some are in the manual but lots more information is online

and please  do not hang this right next to where you want to sit and enjoy your outdoor space  this unit attracts pests  and kills them  but there is a small time gap between when the pests show up and when they die  if you put this unit too close to your enjoyment areas youll actually have more bugs  i am amazed by all the bad reviews i see about devices that attract pests because the owner had not thought about how something like this actually works nor had they read or followed the instructions  you need this unit close enough to your enjoyment area to reduce the local population of pests but far enough away so it is drawing bugs away from you and not towards you  </rant>  

youll need some way to hang this thing as it doesnt have any feet the bait cup is on the bottom and youll just end up with a pile of bugs ruining your zapper if you dont hang it up lol  i just went down to my local home improvement store where they had several options  check out the garden section for hanging plants and those are good options  i found tall metal rods that stick in the ground like a stake and have a loop and hook at the top  great if you want the unit freestanding and want to move it around easily  i bought a simple 1215 inch long hanging basket bracket  it screws to a fence or your house or anything else and works as you might imagine  no big deal there

also  the bottom of the black outer cage is not flat on the bottom so its not stable standing upright  i think they should have done a tiny bit better with that as the bait holders are what makes it unstable  a tiny adjustment to the mold for the plastic outer grid would fix that  but thats a very minor issue as its only like that while you work with it  do be careful though  if you drop it hard on the base you might break the small plastic tabs that hold the bait cups in  they are also the bulb retainers so they are important even if you dont use baits

and on the topic of luresbaits and attractants  all names for the same things  this unit comes with one small octenol lure  i think just a 400mg time release one  depending on where you live you might need other baits if you are after mosquitoes specifically like i am  in houston we have a wide variety of species  so i ordered a combination of lures from an online company  you cant find the right baits on amazon unfortunately  for all types of mosquitoes you need three key lure ingredients  octenol attracts the classic mosquitoes  ones that are active in the morning right at dawn and evening right at dusk  but for other types like tiger mosquitoes that bite during the brightest sun of the day as well as night evening holidays etc you need a combination of lactic acid which is found on human skin and ammonium bicarbonate  depending on your location species of mosquitoes and other factors you will need to adjust your baits  of course you can test to see what kind of results you get with no baits too  that might be enough and if it is  you have a 100 maintenance free solution  me  i hate mosquitoes and they love me so total eradication to whatever extent was possible was my goal

this unit obviously needs to be plugged in  the instructions say to use a cord and connector made for this purpose but i didnt see anything like that down at the depot of home improvement  i ended up buying a 50 ft landscaping extension cord that was dark green in color and rated for outdoor use  given the huge increase in holiday light displays i would imagine anything fit for outdoor christmas lights would work here  if you are paranoid and have the money you can of course hire an electrician to wire you up something fancy

last  before i went and bought my extension cords mounting brackets and got myself invested in a permanent install i wanted to do a simple test  i put the octenol lure in place rigged a hanging option by screwing a small piece of wood into a tree and hung the unit about 23 feet above the ground  about where your legs would be exposed wearing shorts lol  then i stuck a clean white piece of material under the trap to make it easy to see any dead mosquitoes  i used a styrofoam cooler lid but whateverjust make sure it doesnt blow away  a brick solved that for me

at first i was sad  despite dozens of mosquitoes swarming around me and ready to feast on my flesh i heard not one zap of the power grid and no dead bugs  so i left it to run for a while  after about 90 minutes a heavy storm was rolling in so i figured my test was over as any evidence would get blown or washed away  and behold  there were about a dozen or so dead mosquitoes on the foam lid  success  they appeared to be only one or two species  but once the additional baits are delivered and installed i expect improved results

i cant say longer term how well this unit will reduce the population of mosquitoes or even if it will be enough to be able to go outside and not get bitten  but it does kill mosquitoes in the houston area and hopefully with additional attractants it will get those aggressive and horrible tiger

my next project  once i hang these up get the additional baits and see how those perform is to consider adding co2 to the mix  carbon dioxide is probably the best mosquito bait  which is why you see all those propane traps that make co2 and heat by burning propane  my plan is different  im following the method used by health workers around the world to trap mosquitoes for health and medical research  dry ice  the plan is to buy a simple insulated container to hold the dry ice a thick cooler so it will last a long time and some simple plastic tubing  punch a hole in the cooler down low put in the dry ice seal it up so the vapors get forced thru the tube  put the end of the tube inside my bug zapper so the mosquitoes are drawn into the killing grid  done  ill only go that far if the other options arent fully successful

overall  i like this product because it is simple inexpensive and durable  but by adding baits and other attractants you can scale it up to suit your needs and still spend way less money than the fancier products with fans and nets and propane tanks

other options  and why i didnt choose them over this product

i was reluctant to spend hundreds of dollars on one  of the mosquitospecific trapstyle products like the mosquito magnet for a few reasons

1  the huge number of reviews about the unit breaking down strike 1 the huge number of reviews indicating service was difficult strike 2 and the huge cost of repair sometimes costing a fair percentage of the original purchase price strike 3  so ability to maintain one of these things was questionable

2  all the trap style units require significant use of expendables  tanks of propane proprietary nets that degrade dry rot or wear out  special batteries and electronics  even the lures/attractants used have to be purchased in specific form factors and shapes to fit the machine unlike the flowtron zapper that you could literally stick a bait anywhere on under or in  yes there are two small nooks at the base of the bulbs designed for this purpose but theres no reason to think the trap wouldnt work well if you added some alternate bait types and just stuck lashed or otherwise affixed them using your own creativity  most of the trapstyle units are not designed to work if you get creative with the bait placement  they require it to be in a very specific place to lure the mosquitoes into the vacuum suction area  like your home vacuum cleaner  just a few inches away from the nozzle and theres very little suction

3  there seemed to be much fewer placement options as most of the traptype units appeared to simply sit on the ground  most had wheels of some kind  it wasnt like you could hang them from a fence post sort of arrangement or swag them to a tree  since i wasnt sure where theyd end up i wanted something smaller and more easily moved around as needed to get the best results

i also didnt want one of those yard misting systems  spraying chemicals regularly onto my yard just wasnt for me  plus that is really expensive has significant consumable costs and needs space for the large tank of chemical and pump and such

spraying chemicals on my body?  no thanks  maybe for camping in the everglades but around my home not happening

i tried one of those fogger guns  you know the type that are sometimes powered by propane and some are electric?  they use a special oilbased product to create an ultrafine mist with droplets hundreds or thousands of times smaller that what a garden spray set to fine produces  the idea is that the fog can permeate in and around foliage leaves and just about everything else providing absolute and complete coverage  takes <5 minutes to do your yard just a few minutes for the fog to dissipate and you are bugfree for hours  only it didnt take 5 minutes  it took five minutes for the unit to heat up hot enough to use  and then you had to pump the oil into the fogging chamber with a squeeze trigger  on problem is that the rate at which you pump must be precise  otherwise the fog is too wet or dry per the instructions  i found my unit constantly sending out not only fog but also little droplets of oil out the tip  the fog is supposed to make a quart of oil last for weeks or months even but unless you product fog and only fog the product is consumed much faster  all this is completely dependent on you holding the unit level during use and squeezing the trigger at just the right rate  and that rate varies based on outside temp and other factors  so you have to be a master at this  and you have to fog every time you want to enjoy your yard  i found it took 15 minutes or so to lug the unit out plug it in let it warm up fog the yard and then you must let it cool down for 10 minutes or so before you can store it  to give you an idea of the heat  flames can shoot out of the fogger if you use it wrong and the big fogging chamber has all kinds of warnings on it not to touch it ever

last were the cliponyourperson type repellents  some had good reviews and they seemed like a viable option  relatively cheap easy to use no waiting minimal expendable/consumable items  ill be honest  i didnt try these even though they were among the better options per my criteria  i couldnt see keeping spares on hand when guests stopped by  what if we had a party?  would women in nice cocktail dresses be clipping these to their straps or ankles?  too many logistical complications here  these products have their place but not for keeping your home and your castle free of pests

and beyond purchased products  there are any number of diy mosquito control methods  from 2 liter bottle with yeast in them to box fans with netting  i found it hard to separate truth from fiction but in the end i did manage to find some studies done by the bill and melinda gates foundation the national institutes of health and other organizations  see  mosquitoes carry some nasty diseases  finding a cheap way to control them in 3rd world countries is a big deal  what i ultimately found is that most of those homemade systems do work but arent powerful or effective enough for population control  theyll catch some mosquitoes and you will think they are working  but just do the real world test  walk around outside and see if you get bitten  thats ultimately what will determine if my methods are successful or not

and if youve read this far god bless you  i hope you found this useful and worthwhile",very good,very good,very good,very good,very good
"well as you can see from the title im a pest control operator i rely on devices like this for my industry work and this is by far one of my best go to items for my properties i service

im writing this post as a testimonial of how durable this little beast is like a moron here recently cleaning out my chemical shed and equipment shed i was eliminating boxes and whelp you guessed it i forgot to put the box back inside this was in november with all the rain work etc going on i neglected to put the boxes in the recycling til last saturday now april when i opened the box and tipped it over the unit just gushed out water i say to myself theres no way its good anymore so today before i go to throw it out im like well its had 3 days drying out what the heck and it lit up bright as the day it was new out of the box

yes im the past ive received units with bad bulbs and sometimes a unit is bad altogether but ive purchased hundreds of these and ive maybe had 2 or 3 bad ones

also remember if youre having attraction issues check your pheromone attachment for the mosquitoes as it could be outdated and for the love of god please dont put these near your doors and or sitting areas

the damn thing is used to attract things away from you to kill them not to you and say oh hey why am i gonna want chicken when i have a nice filet minion right here youre the filet so please read the directions closely and or request help from your local pest control professional these do work great but its just one of many tools needed to control the insects that outnumber us 200 million to 1",-,very good,very good,very good,very good
"i ordered the flowtron bk80d bug zapper after having used a different smaller model which was also made by flowtron model bk7  the bk7 model worked okay but quickly clogged up with bugs pretty much each night  after about a week of this it shorted out so badly that it melted a hole in the plastic part which held the wires apart  that was the end of that  the bk7 model used a series of round wires that go horizontally but this tended to trap the bugs  even with constant cleaning it was always giving me problems

after it went out i decided to give flowtron one last shot  i saw the model bk80 on amazoncom and ordered it after reading the reviews  i have installed the unit on the corner of my house and it works amazingly well

i put the zapper on an outdoor timer which turns the unit on around 7 pm in the evening and then off automatically around 8 am when the sun comes up  this works great  the timer i used was the intermatic model hb31r sold on amazon and at local building stores  its a very simple little timer with a nice cover to keep the weather out  i ran the power cords with a j loop in them so any rain water would drip off the bottom of the j and not get into the socket

anyway the timer is very simple to use and makes a great additon to the flowtron  the flowtron bk80d is well made and straight forward  on my unit as i had done with the previous bk7 model and as mentioned by another reviewer i took some pruning sheers and cut out every other plastic slat in order to allow easier cleaning and so that larger bugs can get in more quickly

the unit gives off a lot of light and is able to attract bugs from both the first level and 2nd level of my house i have it mounted above the 2nd story deck on the corner  it draws all of the moths that used to hang out on our windows  from as far away as about 30 or 40 feet  one zap and they are toast  the design of the bk80d is much better than other models i have seen  the vertical rods are well made and allow the bugs to slide down and fall out of the unit after they are killed  not all bugs fall out but i would say about 95 or so do fall out of their own accord  by morning time the wind has also helped blow some of the rest out of the unit and they have fallen on the deck

interestingly enough where i live yellowjackets have figured out that any bugs stuck in the rods are a free lunch  and since my unit goes off at dawn via the timer the yellowjackets can get in there and remove any stuck moth bodies without being zapped in the afternoon  its a great deal for me since it saves a little clean up  i have actually seen the yellowjackets wiggle the stuck insect bodies until they come loose from the rods then they fly off with them  it also seems like they clean up the ones that have fallen on the deck although that may be birds stopping by in the morning and/or the wind blowing them off the side of the deck  im not sure  whatever the case the unit requires almost zero cleaning and doesnt clog up hardly at all

while this unit is a little more pricey than some the extra few bucks are well worth it  the gold ring at the top used to hang the unit is sort of poorly designed but its easy to replace with a little work if you want mine had a big gap in it  almost enough to allow the ring to come off the mounting point which i didnt like  however this may actually be there to help taking the unit on and off a hook or something  in my case i simply cut the ring off with some bolt cutters and put a smaller stainless steel split ring in its place  most people probably wouldnt mind the standard gold ring that comes with the unit but i am very picky 

note that you will need to purchase an extension cord to use this unit  the cord that comes out of  the unit is only about 6 inches in length  its not long enough to reach anything  i bought a 12 foot extension cord and ran it along the house and over to the intermatic timer  then the timer plugs into any standard outdoor outlet

since using the unit there have been almost zero moths bugging us  i live out in the forest so there is no shortage of bugs flying around here  even with other lights on the bugs seem to favor the flowtron  the unit does make noise when the bugs are zapped as all units do but since the bugs routinely fall away from the zapping rods pretty quickly much better than with other units its only a short zap  once in a while there will be a longer zap but not too often  at the rate this unit kills bugs i think i may make a dent in the bug population around here  which is fine with me

the unit has two bulbs that are easy to replace  each one is held into place with a plastic clipin cup sort of affair  this cup also doubles as the holder for the ma1000 octenol attractant cartridges although i have yet to use those  the unit does come with one sample cartridge so you can try it  the instructions say the light heats up the cartridge and then it gives off its scent to attract mosquitos  like i say i havent had a chance to try it it seems to work fine without it

all in all a top notch design makes life a lot nicer without having to constantly fight moths and flying bugs  i think youd be hard pressed to find a better bug zapper for the home/yard",very good,very good,very good,very good,very good
so i tried other similar bath scrubbers with extension poles etc  that where  flimsy  and hard to control the brush heads flopping around but this has great feature where you stabilize the cleaning head in different positions the only thing i changed was the pole to a longer telescopic one for our cleaning business and it works better and faster for us another plus is the scrubber head is not glued on so when it gets  gunky and gross you can pull it off the velcro head and put one of those similar ones at any box store or order on amazon,-,very good,-,very good,very good

"it does what is supposed to but im using this in a retail setting and im picky

the bristles  it does work of course  it has this nifty scraper to pull off any hair that builds up on the bristles which is handy but the bristles are bouncy/springy if that makes any sense because of that alot of my dirt gets thrown to far past the pile on my tile and prego floors
the handle when you put the dust pan on the ground and set the handle up so you can sweep dirt into itthe handle will fall over unless you lock it in place which does take a little pressure does cause the dust pan to bend but doesnt cause damageyet?? idk then to unlock it you step on the dust pan to hold it in place push the handle forward and go on your waywhich is not convenient to me
storage i have a small storage area so i store my broom on the handle clasp with the bristles inside of the dust pan standing up on endthis one does not do that it falls over every time  i also want the bristles on the inside of the dust pan so no left behind dirt falls on the top on the dust pan or the floor",-,bad,bad,-,bad
"the upright dust pan combo sweep set is a great tool for anyone who wants to keep their floors clean and tidy this set includes a broom and a dustpan that can be easily assembled together to create an upright and ergonomic cleaning tool

one of the best things about this sweep set is its ergonomic design the broom and dustpan are both designed to be used while standing upright which means you dont have to bend over to sweep and collect dirt and debris this makes it much easier on your back and knees especially if you have a lot of sweeping to do

the broom itself is made of highquality materials and features durable bristles that are great for sweeping up all kinds of debris including dust dirt and small pieces of trash the dustpan is also welldesigned with a deep and wide collection area that makes it easy to sweep up even large piles of dirt and debris

another great feature of this sweep set is its compact and lightweight design the broom and dustpan can be easily disassembled for storage or transport and they dont take up much space this makes them great for small apartments or homes where storage space is at a premium

i bought this to use for walkin showers i have a cleaning business and the wonderful girl who cleans the bathrooms has ruined so many pairs of pants on the knees i have begun buying some for her also the small brush she was using to get between the grout was a tedious chore i went to amazon of course and began to research this brush had mostly 5 stars across the board i read most of them after looking at so many different ones i chose this you wouldnt believe how awesome it is i got hugs and tears from her no bending no cramped hands and elbows and no getting on the knees its no bigger than a swiffer mop and light weight the swivel brush goes from floor to corners with ease some of the showers we do are the size of a normal entire bathroom marble and all tiles clean with ease including the shower walls can you tell how excited i am? you will not be sorry for purchasing this i would give it 10 stars if possible now to see how long it lasts hopefully a very long time,-,very good,very good,-,very good

i was concerned as to whether this would work on my grout in the kitchen as i have tried some other methods  our contractor didnt put down a seal because the box of grout said he didnt need to but we have seen it get dirtier and dirtier  the picture shows our cabinets as a line as to what has been scrubbed with the brush and what hasnt  it is an amazing difference  i am 76 years old and i needed to do this in two installations and stopped at the cabinet  i was amazed at how easy this was since i was able to do it all standing up in less than an hour  i have a cordless floor cleaner that sucks up the dirty water and i used it after i used the brush with a solution of simple green,-,good,-,good,good

ive gotten about every size boveda they make and theyre all top notch but if i had to pick a size it would be this one here the bigger ones can be overkill and sometimes you just need a couple of these smaller packs and youre good they last a long time if used properly i have some in curing jars that have been there for over three months and they still feel squishy i know theres a cheaper alternative but thats all it is cheaper not effective why go through all that time and potential stress only to fumble at the end? these are tried and true and easy to use dont go fixing things if they arent broken,very good,very good,very good,-,very good

"i recently purchased the furdozer x3 pro 3in1 pet hair remover  auto detailer and i must say im thoroughly impressed with its performance although i dont own a pet yet ive found it extremely useful in removing hairs and lint from various surfaces around my home

my vacuum cleaner isnt always capable of picking up every single hair but the furdozer x3 pro makes quick work of those stubborn strands its 3in1 functionality has been a lifesaver allowing me to use it on different surfaces like carpets furniture and even my car interiors the auto detailer feature adds an extra touch of professionalism to my cars interior cleaning process

what i appreciate most about this product is its ergonomic design which makes it comfortable to hold and easy to maneuver around tight spaces the reusable brush head saves me money on replacements and effortlessly glides over various materials picking up stray hair without causing any damage

overall the furdozer x3 pro 3in1 pet hair remover  auto detailer has become an essential part of my cleaning toolkit even if you dont have a pet this versatile tool provides great value for anyone looking to maintain a clean home or vehicle i highly recommend it",very good,very good,-,very good,very good
this would be great if it had a pole on it where you dont have to bend over it also is time consuming i think its better to to just vacuum using just a regular vacuum cleaner on it i was surprised that i went back with this and it picked up what the vacuum cleaner didnt pick up a lot i would imagine you could use the hand vacuum and it might pick up as well i have back problems so its not ideal for me i used it on my bed where my cats lay and it worked very well  i was impressed,-,very good,very good,-,very good
i have a lowpile rug that is impossible to get perfectly clean with a sweeper i used sticky lint rollers for several years after sweeping but the amount of removed fur is much greater with the furdozer one must apply significant pressure to the furdozer to remove fur that is below the surface and within the rug fibers but the outcome is very good the rug looks like it just arrived from the factory  this is not a fast process but if you are someone that wants your rug to look perfect this is the only tool that seems to work,-,very good,-,-,very good

easy to use and does remove pet hair you have to however press down to get hair to move with it worked great on my couch and carpet however on my bread spread i had to be careful not to press too hard to catch the stitches and was harder to get around all the patterns it did move hair but you really had to work for it and it caused  static cling with the hair and cleaner  i put it into pile and had to use sticky roller tape to get off beadspread didnt have to use as much roller tape  it would be awesome if they had it set up so hair would automatically go into a container less mess that way,-,very good,-,very good,very good
i use it to clean corner of carpet very effective and beats doing it with my fingers,-,very good,-,-,very good

just opened it after vacuuming and i have cleaned so much dog hair off of literally everything that the vacuum has already went over i will say that after just using it for an hour ive already noticed the rubber does start to wear down i would compare to like an eraser on your pencil or the tread on your shoe still works fine being worn down will probly last longer the less often you use it ill be getting some more,-,neutral,-,-,neutral

"if you have a cat this product will change your life  when wellapplied paired with the booda clean step dome litter box

i never write reviews but i had to for this

one little known fact about sphynx cats is that
their feces is absolutely toxic no matter the food when the cat exercises her bowels the noxious smell permeates the house  navigating 180° turns to the opposite cornern of the structure the narrow stairs passageway and all upstairs rooms ive never encountered anything like it and never will

nothing has ever made any difference ever we actually hung charcoal bags on the walls of her porch  to no effect this is a different brand but in general i myself cannot endorse charcoal bags when hung on the wall

that said our litter box the booda clean step dome has a recessed partly open space on top for their floppy little filter  useless in the first place and then destroyed by the cat

the dimensions of these particular charcoal bags are an ideal fit for that recessed space we hoped for any small decrease in the smells potency or speed of movement

by the very first night we were speechless she had used her box multiple times  and absolutely zero smell anywhere not even by the box we didnt believe it but she kept eating and evacuating and we kept smelling nothing

the bag is magic when applied correctly if you are here for your litter box you need to get this in combination with the booda done

also the breeding industry responsible for these inbred maladies is heartless a breeder will pretend they care but their cats are money machines to them pumping out a living product to sell adopt",good,good,good,good,good

these gloves are pretty long they cover the expanse of your arm i also have some questions about the durability of them as they seem pretty thin in material so much so that you can feel the heat from hot water pretty clearly  as if there is no protection at all on your hands i use these for washing dishes to get my hands not from pruning up and it suffices in that regard but i am not super pleased with them,-,poor,-,poor,poor

"as someone who absolutely detests scrubbing soap scum off my shower i cannot emphasize enough how the drill bit scrubber has been an absolute game changer these scrubber attachments have made my shower look brand new and i am thrilled with the results

the drill bits come in various sizes making it easy to clean different areas such as tiles grout and corners they attach to any standard power drill turning it into a powerful scrubbing machine i was amazed at how quickly the soap scum and grime disappeared from my shower walls and floor

however do keep in mind that the powerful scrubbing action can cause a bit of window splatter so its essential to take proper precautions i recommend wearing eye protection and covering nearby surfaces or using a towel to avoid excess splatter its a small tradeoff for the incredible cleaning power these attachments provide

with the drill bit scrubber gone are the days of spending hours scrubbing my shower by hand it has saved me so much time and effort and i cannot recommend it enough if youre tired of fighting stubborn soap scum do yourself a favor and get these scrubber attachments you wont regret it",-,very good,very good,very good,very good

"when i saw this brand of prerolled cones i decided to give them a shot since they were priced lower than my usual brand raw

unfortunately the paper is rolled at an angle which forces an inseam inside the cone the opening which is supposed to slide on to the shooter can only get about halfway onto the shooter lip

about 3/4 of the cones are too mutilated to work with a shooter total waste of money and really frustrating to boot

also they use plastic straws to contain the cones

im going back to raw for good

after an unfortunate series of misadventures with inferior disposable cups we metcute and then fell in love with these might as well call them the keepers because youll be with these until you die like any good partner these are reliable consistently spillproof dependable always free of leaks and very good looking now we have always used these for commuting with hot coffee where the cups builtin insulation keeps the heat in the cup and doesnt burn the hand our only quibbles are the nonrecyclable lids and that the cups stick together in the sleeve but no matter if you routinely travel with coffee you can buy 85 cups and lids for the price of approximately 10 cups of starbucks coffee and have the confidence you wont spill it on your clothes or car cap off your commute game with these,very good,very good,-,very good,very good

these cups are the best ones out there  they are sturdy and keep your fingers from burning with hot beverages  the only criticism i have is the lids could be better  sometimes they crack and dont hold up but weve had that issue with other brands of cups  so we keep buying these because the actual cup is great and not flimsy,-,-,very good,-,very good

of all the scrubby scrubs that i have ever purchased this scrubby scrub exceeded my expectations many scrubby scrubs fail to remove hard stuck on grime but not this scrubby scrub from dirty to spotless with only a few flicks of the wrist this scrubby scrub left me thinking “wow” because it was so handy i thought “what other purposes could i use this scrubby scrub for?” after much contemplation i thought of the casserole dish in the refrigerator it had been in there for weeks so i went to work with haste again this scrubby scrub rose to the task dish after dish and one by one this scrubby scrub continues to preform never leaving me wanting thank you scott,-,bad,-,-,bad
i almost didnt buy these because the reviews were all over the place but luckily i did because theyre just what i wanted and expected what i received perfectly matches the image on the amazon page you can either punch out the hole for the soap or leave it in this will depend on what type of wand you have do a quick search on types of scotch brite soap wands and youll see what i mean some have soap flow control and others do not this explains why some of us have had soapy messes after purchases certain replacements these replacements will work for both wand types youll just have to remove the circle if your wand requires it otherwise put it on and its good to go theyre the same durable and affordable wand replacements we all begrudgingly buy because we have dishes that need cleaned these wands at least make that job a little less painful and now that i can get them delivered without having to track them down in the store i think i might actually subscribe to something to be delivered monthly great value for the money,very good,very good,-,-,very good

"i found that they do break up while in a container w/lid of water  shake the tissue in the water for a very short time
i like the feel of them and the smell they have  one has to be a bit careful in using as one can easily put a hole thru one  part of the problem is trying to see where the strip begins  sometimes it can be found but when the begin of one is toward either side of the package its very difficult to see  then is extremely hard to get a finger to the beginning  if the manufacture could line them up better it wont be so hard to grab one  thats only reason i gave 4 stars instead of 5

never thought id write a review for bathroom wipes but here goes ive been using grocery store brand bathroom wipes for years i decided to find a better deal on amazon and found these the best thing about these is that they clean better than common grocery store brands the are also soft dont leave any lint like some brands can and i think are supposed to break down better as well i docked one star because they dont continuously dispense once you remove one the next doesnt pop out of the opening so you have to dig each one out i think that keeps the top one from drying out which could be seen as a benefit,-,-,-,-,-
difficult to pull from pack  doesnt pull up next edge,-,-,-,-,-
it is flushable environment friendly however it tears so easy when taking out of the package before each and every use perhaps making the dispenser a little larger may help seem to use alot more wasting due to ripping but that could be fixed,-,good,-,good,good
"i wish i would have paid more attention to the ingredients there is a significant amount of alcohol in these so if you have sensitive bits and crevices it will burn ill leave it at that also it is hard to get it out without yearning them or popping a hole in them and im sorry but if you use it for what youll want a solid piece of paper between you me the item you are wiping especially if its a child or another person you have to wipe
it works well though once you do use it but you have to make sure you dont have anything sensitive in the wiping area so you dont get hurt by the wipe grimacing faceflushed face",-,very good,-,-,very good
the wipes themselves are a bit like the wipes you have to use in the doctors office before giving a urine sample they smell medical and they arent the softest however they do not give my sensitive skin a rash or infection they break apart a bit easy and are hard to take out of the package as they stick down they dont feel very “wet” which isnt a terrible thing since they work like wet wipes still theyre just a very strange texture/smell,-,very good,-,very good,very good
these do the job and are great for travel but i find them highly fragrances and thats not something i like to use for a bum wipe theyre not very soft either they almost remind me of the highly fragrance hand towelettes the flight attendants gave out before a meal for the price id buy them again just to leave in the car or for a travel bag i dont like them for daily use at home for restroom purposes,good,good,-,-,good

i learned about this option from someone who uses the rolls but there are no perforations and  again  the dispensers are not only expensive but i dont have a place to conveniently install one im too much of a neatnik to live with the jagged tears i would get with the rolls so these squares are great for me

i have about three storebought paper towel rolls in the garage but now having these which i open the packets one at a time to store in a shoebox which i keep in the kitchen i believe i have a lifetime supply of both kinds

added bonus i just happened to have a birkenstock brand empty shoebox the way the lid works is very different from all the other shoeboxes i ever owned i put one batch of the towels in sideways in the box  perfect fit  and when i pulled one out it automatically left me with the beginning of the next one to pull on its a free dispenser how cool is that?",very good,very good,very good,very good,very good

really get a the water off the glass and makes the shower glass look great after a shower  no streaking and no water spots  i was skeptical at first but it was a great pickup,-,-,-,-,-

"my last review is below i have since lowered the rating to 3 stars based on the latest shipment the quality has deteriorated the whiteness and absorbability  not sure if thats a word have declined the product wasnt the greatest at tearing off but now its worse you basically have to hold the towel in one hand and rip with the other to get an even tear the price is ok but i did find one less expensive for what turns out to be almost identical quality still not great but saves some cash i had said i will continue to purchase now i doubt it

weve been purchasing this item for over a year on an as needed basis the convenience is a huge plus plus the ease of purchase speedy delivery eliminating the bulky in store purchase supply issues and extra cost its not the highest quality but after trying and comparing other products both online and in store this product is the best value the absorbency is good enough for our use  any huge spills will have to handledwith multipletowels the roll is large fits on our spindle and the quarter tear sheets extend the life of the roll overall very good and we will continue to purchase",very good,very good,very good,-,very good

i bought these because they look sleek and clean i thought the rubber bristles would make them less likely to mold and rust  which is true they do a good job in the bowl but dont work well for getting up underneath the rim of the toilet the smaller brush they come with will work for that but i have to put my hand too far into the toilet for my liking i am keeping and using them but will probably get something with a little different design next time,-,very good,very good,very good,very good

not flimsy you dont fear them bending in the middle and dumping food while on your lap  and the sides are tall enough to contain some liquid from foods  any paper plate will work for say pizza but you need these for food that needs to be eaten with a spoon or fork or that can be messy  i got 150 and gave half away to my dil  she loves em,-,good,-,-,good

"we moved last march to a house with lvp flooring i am 70 yrs old and have chronic pain issues while our dogs were getting acclimated to a doggie litter box and a new space i had a very tedious process of wiping up the mess and then mopping with a swiffer with a reusable pad and then using another mop to rinse this repeated several times a day for dog issues and our own tracking the lvp floor might as well be glass because it shows shoe prints foot prints and foot prints if youre wearing socks it drives me crazy
i did that cleaning process for a couple of months feeling like my life was now as a mop woman and then i discovered this beauty it was just what i wanted before i even knew it existed i didnt want something that dispensed water and sucked it up ive done that with a carpet cleaner and it ended up smelling like dog pee plus the dirty water tank is gross to clean this is perfect its light its easy to push around i bought extra pads and switch them out and wash them all together when they are all dirty its so easy to use i just roll it out easily if we have a sticky spot in the kitchen or if the dogs track in footprints it is so easy to use i use simple green bio dog because i like the smell the floor dries quickly better than my mopped floor technique did i dont mind the cord at all and its a nice long one the only change id want is a light in the front like my vacuum has because we have bad lighting but its not a game changer the screws came out on the rotators but we figured out you have to tighten the screws in the opposite direction i saw some reviewers had problems with that thinking it was broken
ive had this lovely creation for several months and if it did break down i would immediately order another one i love this mop and think everyone should have one",-,very good,very good,very good,very good
"the bissell spinwave expert hard floor spin mop is an excellent cleaning tool that i would highly recommend this mop has made my life so much easier when it comes to cleaning my hard floors

first of all the spinwave technology is fantastic the mop has two spinning pads that clean the floors with ease the pads are gentle enough to use on any hard floor surface yet they are tough on dirt and grime i was impressed with how easily the mop glided across my floors and how effortlessly it removed dirt and stains

another great feature of this mop is the ondemand spray with just a press of a button you can dispense cleaning solution onto the spinning pads making it easy to tackle tough messes i appreciate that i dont have to lug around a separate spray bottle or bucket of water while cleaning

the mop is also very easy to use it has a swivel head that allows me to easily maneuver around furniture and other obstacles additionally the mop pads are machine washable which saves me money in the long run by not having to constantly buy replacement pads

overall the bissell spinwave expert hard floor spin mop is a great investment for anyone who wants to make cleaning their hard floors a breeze it is durable easy to use and gets the job done efficiently i highly recommend this product",very good,very good,-,very good,very good
i read the reviews but was still not sure if it would be easier than my steam mop it is i was pleasantly surprised at how well it handles scrubs and picks up everything  i have hardwood floors and tiles and it performed beautifully with no hard work on my part it was so easy i did the whole condo in one fell swoop the only drawback i can see is corners the round heads dont get into that tight a space however any mop has the same issue and it is a small enough task to spray the corner let it sit while you finish up the floor and go back and hand wipe out the corner i used very little of the tank i only filled to the small level was able to clean my 748 sq ft condo and have over half left in the tank excellent product,-,very good,-,-,very good
i ordered this a couple of weeks ago i just tried it out for the first time this morning it is super easy to use i filled the container with warm water as directed but only used about a third of the recommended amount of the cleaner because we are sensitive to strong smells i did 5 rooms in about 2030 minutes with no effort except moving furniture this thing pretty much moves on its on you just push the spray button and guide it  the pads are washable and the water tank just lifts off  bissell if you dont have a cordless one make one i would definitely buy it people if you have pets buy this you wont be disappointed grinning cat,-,very good,very good,very good,very good
i am absolutely blown away by this amazing gadget i have mopped and steam mopped over and over and always felt like my floors were still dirty and couldnt even pretend to get my grout cleaned without getting on my hands and knees with one cleaning with the scrub pads this amazing machine got my floor cleaner than it has ever been getting out brown parts on the tile i thought were maybe part of the design nopeit was dirtick and even scrubbed the grout getting out sticky dried popsicle i am wowed cant recommend this enough  it is worth every penny,-,-,-,very good,very good
i do about 90 of the house work and got this to speed along moping the floors  i used it today to do 2 car bays and an rv bay  i use my foam spray gun to hose everything down and usually use a big shop broom to scrub  this spring i whipped out the spin mop soaped up the bays good and squeegee out the water  worked great  i also use it in the walk in shower on the floor and walls,-,good,-,-,good

"i first purchased them for a family picnic and was initially impressed by their sturdiness and of course their compostability  i took some home to test them myself  they are very sturdy and wont collapse under a full plate of light foods  for me the most impressive feature is their sustainability  i generally stack mine with mostly raw veggies raw fruit sandwiches a hot dog pizza green salads plain jello etc  i live alone so im all for saving water and a very quick cold rinse does a good job as long as it was not stew soup pasta sauce etc they come in 2 sizes 6 and 9 i currently use the 6 plates but ill order the 9 too for those days when i need a sandwich and salad and even maybe
some corn on the cob",-,good,-,-,good

these are just your run of the mill commercial type of paper towel which does a decent job of drying hands after they been washed theyre a little rough and scratchy but at this price im sure youre not expect them to be 100 egyptian cotton soft",good,good,good,-,good
"i dont know about you but i do not like to use the expensive paper towels too much it makes me feel wasteful there are so many times i need to clean up little spills on the floor and the drain catchers in the kitchen sink where things like coffee grinds and other smallish waste collects i can even tear these in half in a straight line for when i dont need the whole sheet you have to tear on the correct side or it will tear very jagged and not straight at all

i learned about this option from someone who uses the rolls but there are no perforations and  again  the dispensers are not only expensive but i dont have a place to conveniently install one im too much of a neatnik to live with the jagged tears i would get with the rolls so these squares are great for me

i have about three storebought paper towel rolls in the garage but now having these which i open the packets one at a time to store in a shoebox which i keep in the kitchen i believe i have a lifetime supply of both kinds

added bonus i just happened to have a birkenstock brand empty shoebox the way the lid works is very different from all the other shoeboxes i ever owned i put one batch of the towels in sideways in the box  perfect fit  and when i pulled one out it automatically left me with the beginning of the next one to pull on its a free dispenser how cool is that?",very good,very good,very good,very good,very good

"the lighters arrived on time they were beautifully wrapped in a nice box of course they do not have the butane in them so we had to buy that separately now that weve had them for a little while i have noticed that caution is important 🫣 as they get things very very hot and fast the only negative is when held sideways it will sometimes go out and become difficult to relight either adding more fuel or turning up the fuel gauge usually fixes this the lighters are much larger than i expected but overall is a good lighter we bought this for our kitchen smoker and it works good as long as you dont get it too close to the wood because it has a strong pressure and tends to blow things if its too close like ash im glad i got it but it takes a little bit of getting used to

i was sceptical about buying these because they are such a cheap price for 2 of them i am so glad i decided to just go for it ive gotten a couple of these torch like lighters and all of them almost immediately disappointed me in one way or another except for these ones these lighters do not sputter even when turned upside down to light my candles the flame adjuster is extremely easy to turn up or down and filling them doesnt cause me to end up covered in lighter fluid they slip inside my small purse just right so no more struggling with regular flame lighters while driving or outside and lighting a cigarette all around great,good,good,-,good,good

ive tried several of the “scrub daddy” brand sponges and this one is my favorite to be honest i love all of them but this one is so awesome it cleans well and doesnt hold smells the only downside is that it can be discolored by some foods like tomato sauce which is to be expected since its dye freewhich i love i will purchase again,-,very good,-,-,very good

im mainly writing an amazon review to report the outcome of purchasing online the price is comparable to regular stores but im considering subscribing to save money and keep a supply i received the tub as is no tape or plastic shrinkwrap not sure if thats the norm i did notice that the cap is the standard for wipes and armor all wipes ive had before had that annoying clam trap in the middle i thought that was a newer design probably to keep the wipes from drying out i dont know if they redid the packaging it differs by factory or if these sat in storage but i find it a little odd otherwise the wipes were moist and they clean as they should safe to buy here",bad,bad,-,bad,bad

car surfaces dry quickly and thoroughly  the video here is a time lapse of about one minute

with just a few passes of the wipe the instrument panel door panels steering wheel dash board and other interior surfaces transformed from dingy to sparkling clean using these wipes is much simpler to use than those spray on a cleaners that leave a filmy coating on surfaces i  used a few wipes the first time and achieved a “show room” appearance without having to take it to a professional and paying a hefty price for the same results",very good,very good,very good,-,very good

this microfiber mop easily picks up all the dirt and fuzzies across wood and linoleum floors it practically acts like a magnet in some ways its fairly easy to scoot across the floor and the long handle is great to push around it also helps that the handle can angle any which way to get the mop head wherever you need it to go the cleaning brush it comes with is a nice extra i kinda wish the pads fit the mop head better theyre too big for the head but maybe that bit of floppiness is intentional and makes it move better just drives ocd people like me nuts when you cant seem to put it on exactly even,-,very good,-,-,very good

price at time of review  499
 note that i receive some items at discounted or zero cost through amazon vine participation  the price indicated is the purchase price with or without discounts as advertised on the product page at the time this review is posted

pros useful for tougher scrubbing jobs particularly on metal surfaces in that these will dislodge materials that would be difficult to scrub out with a sponge or standard brush with bristles  used effectively in cleaning out the floor of an oven that had built up some fairly substantial grunge between cleanings  while it didnt get through some mild stains at the bottom even with some force it did separate most of the caked on material which allowed me to utilize other cleaning utensils for that job  the price is currently very reasonable at six for 499

cons  in cleaning oven racks the sponge became largely unraveled  while somewhat effective youre not liable to get multiple uses out of a single sponge

"these pads appear to be comprised of one long curly piece of metal the kind you would see from a metal lathe or milling machine if you were turning a round piece of stock on a lathe

they are not any type of chain mail small metal rings linked together and ive never seen any chain mail with rings this small somehow the pads look enormous in the product pictures but theyre only about 2 ½” in diameter and about an 1 ½” tall

i found them to be much better and longer lasting than your typical steel wool pads that get rusty overnight and leave tiny steel splinters in your fingers these dont do any of that but if you have thin skin you might want to wear dish gloves

functionally theyre great they make short work of any dried or burnedon food on your pots and pans and supposedly they never rust i did note that a magnet sticks to them just like regular steel while good stainless steel generally is nonmagnetic well see if they do rust and if they do ill come back and update my review

you cant use them on any nonstick coated pans or itll probably rip it right off and if you try to use them on porcelain youll leave black marks all over it but thats to be expected with any steel wool scouring pads

pricewise they sounded a little expensive but after checking around theyre not other similar pads were more expensive making these a pretty good deal

these sheets are great in getting our clothes and linens clean without the hassle of liquid detergents i followed the advice of others and tore them into smaller pieces to spread around on top of the clothes so they dont stick to the side of the washer much more efficient than liquid or pods and so much better for our environment,-,-,-,-,-
was using a much more expensive brand before i found these cant tell the difference i have never had the problem others mentioned above sheets sticking or not thoroughly dissolving,good,-,-,-,good
this product will clean your close and is really simple to use  i recommend it and will purchase again,-,very good,-,-,very good
"three cons but id already suspected it may have them when i bought the product so im fine with it also please keep in mind that the competitors are apt to have the same problems for the same reason
1 the entire unit does not easily close up without having to use your hands its doable but takes a midge of time and effort im lazy so am just keeping it open the pan does go into the vertical position well enough but the lid takes a bit of work to get in place maybe the lid would work better if it was made out of metal stiffer and heavier than out of plastic
2 the bristles on the outside of the broom do not stay neatly in the pan when stored in the vertical position they end up squished like a hairdo badly in need of a bcombing again im simply keeping the pan open the bristles get pushed out of place by the sides of the pan i suspect that eventually this will mess up the broom bristles themselves the pan needs to be a midge wider in relation to the width of the broom bristles in order for this not to happen only time will tell
3 the bristles of the broom are very soft and pliable im used to and prefer a stiffer nonplastic type of broom with the fuzzy edges that trap the dust bunnies this means that i have to adjust my stroke style from the one ive been using for years too much pressure down on the broom flings the dirt when i let go i need to do shorter gentler strokes when using this broom too much pressure down on the broom also spreads the hairs apart so that smaller pieces of dirt is missed see the pros for having such soft bristles though an option for a stiffer bristled broom would have been welcome

here are the pros about the product
1 it is light
2 it is very easy to put together
3 it has a tall handle both on the pan and the broom this is the main reason i bought this unit
4 the broom handle easily clicks in place for storage to the pan handle
5 the pro part to having the flimsy hairs on the broom is that it works great with the comb to get dust bunnies off of the broom no more pulling that stuff off by hand
6 it seems sturdy enough ive not put it through its paces for a time yet so dont know for sure
7 nice clean simple look without a bunch of different colors pictures logos etc
8 nice deep pan but easy to dump out
9 for those of you who dont have the vertical space to store such a tall item the poles do come apart

synopsis
i did get this particular model instead of other models due to the lid dont bother the lid does not close at all well but getting this model for the tall poles deep pan and the comb that you can get the dust bunnies off with is well worth it the broom bristles themselves are way too flimsy for me but thats a matter of preference the stiffer bristles that i prefer would not do as well with the comb as for how well it catches the dirt as i sweep i think i just need to adjust my sweeping style to less pressure and smaller strokes you need to decide which is more important to you",-,very good,very good,-,very good
i love this broom set i had bought another one from amazon but it broke apart on me due to it being flimsy this one is so much more sturdy i like that you can put the broom together with the dust pan its even more nice that the broom fits in the dust pan so i can put it away so much more easier the bristles on the broom are actually strong unlike the last one i had which made it hard for me to sweep up anything,-,very good,-,-,very good
simple design simple to use and good construction,-,good,-,good,good
it falls over a lot its great for the price i have only accidentally unscrewed it once lol i love that its tall,very good,very good,-,-,very good
i bought a different brand before my home remodel and i like it because it combed out the broom but it was hard to store and really flimsy when it broke i bought this instead and its way better its durable and the combs are longer so theres never anything left behind in the broom it also tilts up so i can easily store it against the wall in my pantry without taking up too much room highly reccommend,-,good,-,-,good
my name is divine and i got this broom and dust pan set about a month ago i live alone with my cat and shes always shedding so those teeth on the dust pan really make a difference it removes all that build up on the broom i also really like that the height can be adjusted i think its really simple you just put the poles together for the desired height and start cleaning storage is really straightforward as well the dustpan has a little clip that you put the broom on and then the whole thing just folds up id definitely recommend this product its affordable good quality and reliable,very good,very good,-,-,very good
i adjusted the broom size so it fit my height better so no more bending when sweeping which has helped my back plus it actually picks the stuff up off my floors i have vinyl planks i recommend the broom and dustpan set if you dont want to bend when sweeping,-,very good,-,-,very good
when i first opened the box i was not impressed everything seemed so cheap and i didnt think the broom would pick up anything nor make anything into the dustpan after first use though i was pleasantly surprised the broom swept everything up quite well without just throwing dust and dirt around and there was no dirt line after sweeping into the dustpan i really like how it all closes up and the length of the dustpani do wish the broom handle was yet just a little longer im happy with this set overall my only complaint is as im sweeping the broom pieces start to loosen and i need to keep retighting them hopefully that issue will resolve itself with time,very good,very good,very good,very good,very good
"when i first got it i was skeptical and thought “hm can this really replace a toilet brush?” it can
works so great its sanitary doesnt splash goes in those areas a regular toilet brush cannot reach the scotch bright has blue toilet cleaner already integrated in it so all you do is dip it a little in the water scrub throw it out place it back in the holder everything remains clean it has a little hidden compartment for the disposable “sponges”
i could not recommend this enough
the only thing is the disposable “sponges” are by definition not reused so even if you wanna clean just a little you have to throw it out after and it could get expensive but worth it",very good,very good,-,-,very good

"update on amazon basics size d batteries 31123

if yual have been reading my reviews of these i guess it wont come to any surprise that when amazon lowered the price again i bought 2 four packslet me call these battery numbers 13 thru 20these were delivered on 3/1/23these all had a date code of 09/2022i started my normal discharge/charge cycle on my iq338xl chargernow the 1st discharge on these are only telling you what the batteries have in them after sitting on a shelf somewhere until deliverythe 1st discharge isnt all that meaningful except to make sure the batteries arent completely deadand for the 1st time number 13 thru 16 failed the testingi did the same cycling 1 more timeand they didnt recoverthese 4 came in about all the same 7000 mah discharge and around 9000 mah charge for both cyclesthe charger measured the internal resistance from 15 to 30 m ohmsi then started to do the same with the next set of batterieswhich i will call numbers 17 thru 20and these all came in with a discharge of 7400 to 7800 mah and a charge of 11000 mah to 11600 mahthese were all good i sent back the other 4 and amazon sent out replacement batterieswhich i now call 13 thru 16againthese had date codes 04/2022which are even older than the others2 of these checked out oki proceeded to do another discharge/charge cycle on the 2 that didnt measure up to their specificationsthey did come aliveso the new 1316 batteries measured in at 68007400 mah dischargeand 1100012000 mah chargenow remember that the original discharge numbers are what the batteries came with after sitting on the shelf for some timesome nimh batteries it takes a number of cycles to “wake” them upi did 2 cycles on the first set of 1316 and that did nothingwhere the 2nd set of number 1316 2 of 4 came right up to specification and 2 did notanother cycle those 2 came right up to specificationsthe next discharge numbers on fully charged batteries are expecting around 10000 mahthat is just the way they work

this was the first time that i had purchased some bad batteries i always thought bad batteries were just a scare tactic

i will continue to report back on these batteries they all seem to be very goodi have them in a maglite 3 cell flashlight with a very cheap led replacement light installed there are 4 installed in a eton/grundip satellit 750 radio 4 installed in a hf 1250 lumen led lanternand another 6 installed in an older 800 lumen led lanternand 3 sitting in a draweron the shelf

testing these over the years i have come to a 2 year recharge cycle on them unless there is a lot of use which there hasnt beentime will tell more to followthat is if im still around to report back

update on 11122 well the price is finally coming down well done i will update this with more findings on the size c in a week or 2 i just recharged them after 9 months of use in my 1970s sony radio i still see nothing wrong with these batteries they still charge up to the 5000 mah value and beyond more to come the size ds are finally coming down in price also in fact they are almost back to their precovid days but i got a deal on the last prime dayso i purchased 2 more sets of the size d 1 set for my ham satelitte 750 receiver and a hf 1250 led lantern more to come on this too

update on 8922 amazon wont let me relay anything about my size c amazon basics nimh rechargeable batteries that were purchased on 61920 for 1249 for a 4 pack today amazon finally has some of them in stockfor 2099 for a 4 pack all i can say is wow that is quit a price increase in little more than 2 yearsi can hardly wait to see the size d prices if and when they get stock on them btw this is the worse inflationary story of our timethis comes to 68 increase in 2 yearsoutrageous price increase amazon will only let me review my size d purchase on the same date which i can not understand

update on 7/27/21 for tests on 6/11/21 or about 1 year after original review batteries 13 have been insalled in a 3 cell maglite for the year this flashlight has a cheapie led lamp it is of the original mag light design not the newer ones with led lamps there was little use on these batteries the light was tested for 510 seconds each month just as a battery check these were discharged to check remaining charge the discharge ranged from 9052mah to 9724mah which comes out to 9054 to 9274 remaining charge from their rated 10000mah once again these batteries are testing out very nicely they charged up to between 10830mah to 11660mah the internal resistance measured out between 1519 milli ohms these 3 batteries also show low self discharge characteristics

update on 7/27/21 for test on 3/21/21 i took battery 4 which has been sitting in a drawer for 9 months so this is a 9 month shelf life check i discharged  charged the battery the discharge after 9 months was 9230mah that is down ~79 from the rated 10000mah so far this is fantastic and does show that at least 1 of the 4 batteries has low self discharge characteristics this battery measured 15 milli ohm of internal resistance

this review mirrors my review of amazon basics size c nimh batteries

i received these on june 21 2020 i let them sit for an hour to acclimate them to my environment reading the instructions/paper work that came with these you are to charge the batteries at least once every 36 months this does not give me any warm fuzzies about low selfdischarge characteristics of the batteries

now this seems to be in opposition to the web page which states long battery life extremely gradual selfdischarge maintains 80 capacity for 24 months this does give me warm fuzzies about low selfdischarge characteristics of the batteries

but what is it6 months or 2 years time will tell hopefully i will be alive to report on this and amazon accepts my added review which they do not accept very many of my reviews for some reason

now for early testing i used my iq338xl charger for the tests set it to charge test which first discharges the batteries stores the discharge current/time/internal resistance then it charges the batteries stores the charge current/voltage/time/internal resistanceand when all batteries are finished the charger flashes the display this charger is preset at 500 ma discharge and can not be changed so it will take a very long time to completely discharge these size d 10000mahr batteries especially with a full charge on charge this charger current is selectable500 750 1000 and one level higher which i can not recall i set the charge current to 1000ma

upon completion of the testing all of the batteries were between 145 and 146 volts 10830mahr to 11660ma and 1522 mohms internal resistance these batteries came with a charge of 9052mahr to 9724mahr which is 9052 to 9724 of the rated capacity this is fantastic

to completely discharge the battery with 11660mahr charge capacity at 500ma load current would take around 23 hoursso be prepared for the time it takes and then it has to charge themand at 1000ma of charge current it will take almost 1213 hours so basically a day and a half to do 1 cycle of discharge/charge

these batteries were dated december 2019 now for the warm fuzzies of low selfdischargeit is now the 3nd week of june 2020so lets just call it 6 month shelf life and they came with 90 to 97 chargewowhow can this be true??? i have never had this much charge left in any battery after 6 monthsbut the againhow often does amazon charge them while on the shelfno one really knows

well time will tell",very good,very good,very good,very good,very good
"intro
item amazon basics 4pack rechargeable c cell nimh batteries 5000 mah recharge up to 1000x
i purchased amazon and charged these amazon c batteries with xtar vc4sl battery charger and included qc30 adapter
i had problems charging these batteries when they arrived therefore i am including my charging problems and remedies below obviously other chargers may act differently
after reading the reviews for both the batteries and the charger i realized that the charging process takes some hours and that 4 batteries would probably take around 24 hours therefore i charged my amazon c batteries 2 at a time since i had 8 batteries i was able to make sure that all charger slots would work by charging the pairs in different slots
con
there are too many charging modes and choices to understand without spending a lot of time studying only to forget within a few weeks before the next recharging the instructions on line and also printed are abysmal
after i simply inserted for charging my 8 amazon 5000mah c batteries in pairs i was ready to yell because they only reached roughly 1400mah
pro
however the chargers 800 support phone is great
support was patient and good in all respects
eventually i was told to click the little retangular rubber mode button until chg showed up on the screen and then charged my batteries a slow but automatic full process of charge discharge charge this was successful and all of my 8 amazon 5000mah c batteries reached roughly 5000mah",-,very good,very good,-,very good

por otra parte puse a cargar las baterias y dura 330 horas en cargar completamente y a las 2 horas estaba muy caliente casi hirviendo es muy peligroso un incendio pero no por eso deja de ser útil solo hay que tener mucha precaución y tienes que estar en tu casa al pendiente mientras recargas las baterias
yo lo puse a cargar y se puso muy caliente  tanto las baterías como el cargador pero más las baterias y por precaución para evitar cualquier accidente o incendio yo personalmente las puse a cargar y a las 3 horas las desconecte porque se pone muy caliente y deje que se enfriara después las puse a cargar 2 horas más para completar las 5 horas
 yo personalmente les recomiendo que lo pongan a cargar 3 horas luego lo desconecten y dejar que enfríe bien y luego lo vuelve a conectar al enchufe
 y lo carga 2 horas más para completar las 5 horas de carga

 on the other hand i put the batteries to charge and it lasts 5 hours to fully charge and after 3 hours it was very hot almost boiling a fire is very dangerous but that does not mean it stops being useful you just have to be very careful and you have to be at home on the lookout while you recharge the batteries
 i put it to charge and both the batteries and the charger got very hot but more so the batteries  y as a precaution to avoid any accident or fire i personally put them on charge and after 3 hours i disconnected them because it gets very hot and let it cool down then i put them on charge for 2 more hours to complete the 5 hours
  i personally recommend that you put it on charge for 3 hours then disconnect it and let it cool down well and then reconnect it to the socket

theyre made of cellulose which is biodegradable but they do not break down quickly with normal use the best part is they do not hold onto bacteria like plastic sponges do so they never smell like mildew i also make sure to use an ecofriendly dish soap because toxic dish soaps like dawn do make the sponge smell a little bad eventually dawn is toxic to aquatic life as well

"the pack includes a generous amount of 1000 napkins which was great for our familys everyday use the napkins are sturdy and do not tear easily even with heavier use if youre looking for plastic free these are unfortunately wrapped in plastic

one downside i noticed is that the napkins have a slight texture to them which may not be suitable for all occasions additionally they may not be the most costeffective option for frequent use but the ecofriendly benefits may outweigh the cost

overall i would recommend these ecofriendly bamboo paper napkins to anyone looking for a sustainable and sturdy option for their kitchen they are a great alternative to traditional paper napkins and a step towards a more sustainable lifestyle",very good,very good,very good,very good,very good
i like the use of bamboo rather than wood for making these napkins  they work just as  well as the wood based paper ones that i was purchasing at a big box retailer,-,good,-,good,good
i feel like i did taking bamboo an overweight weed and turning it into something planetsaving like a napkin shows how committed i am to reducing my carbon shoe size and helping prevent the earth from exploding which all those treebased napkins will cause it to do so there,-,very good,-,-,very good
used these for our outdoor wedding a little thin but a good dinner napkin size,-,good,-,-,good
i do what i can for the environment these napkins are just as sturdy as regular ones so the extra cost felt worth it to me,good,-,good,-,good
these are bamboo i feel like they are a good product and the quantity for the money is also good,very good,very good,-,-,very good
i love these are a small help with our environment  buy them,-,very good,-,-,very good

"i didnt want to spend more than 15 on a lint shaver for the price  this does the job and does it pretty well box was intact  instructions are in english with pictures  easy to use  i recommend slow circular motion for it to work well  i had a brand new hoodie that had pills after one use and didnt it made it look old  this device made it look brand new again i gave this 4 stars instead of 5 for two reasons  1 it didnt come with replacement blades and i guess ill cross that bridge when i need too but it wouldve been nice if it came with a replacement  id prefer it over the little brush  box does have an email address in order to contact
2 it takes tough love to remove the lint container  instructions sore to pull it down  but i have to hold it sideways close to my body then pull to remove

aside from those two things im glad i didnt spend more than i did on a lint shaver there are some pricey ones on amazon and this does a good job",very good,very good,-,very good,very good
"this depilling is very effective at what it does  removing pills  lint and fuzz from clothing  especially knitwear  a few strokes across an old sweater  and the little stray hairs and balls are removed very nicely  rejuvenating the look of your garment  i also use the unit on my flannel bedsheets

the drawbacks include  the electrical charge from the usb cable only charges the unit for so many minutes of use before you have to reconnect it again  that usb cable is quite short  which is a little irksome  removing the collected lint from the reservoir takes a little practice  and you will probably benefit from using little cuticle scissors to remove some of the tangled fibers if they get wound around the inner capstan

still  even with these caveats  its a great unit for what you pay for",-,very good,very good,-,very good

this product is a must have and works great it easily got rid of all the lint balls on my clothes even smaller less balled ones while its a bit annoying to wait for it to charge it means i dont have to feed it endless batteries so thats a plus the only negative i would say is that it will catch certain fabrics i had lint on the edges of a few bras and it caught the thin and stretchy fabric no big deal since they werent nice ones but just a warning to not use on fabrics like that,-,neutral,-,-,neutral

"ive been buying rayovac alkaline batteries because they give me similar battery life as other brands and guaranteed security of not leaking unlike my previous batteries i purchased from another well known us company with their aa alkaline batteries made in china  my previous battery brand did reimburse me for the leaking batteries along with the balance i still have but what was damaged by the battery leaking in my electronic devices wasnt reimbursed  ive been using approximately 400 aa alkalines per year and have found several leaking batteries that were installed in my devices for the  past 34 years and now repairing those devices is out of the question

i rarely buy any brand other than rayovac the larger packs are an incredible value in my opinion theyre just as good as the more expensive brands but the amount i can get for the price is what i need with 3 kids and a houseful of things that require batteries if you are always in need of batteries i mean daily for one thing or another rayovac is the way to go,good,good,-,-,good

"we have a problem with drain flies and i have bugphobia  ive been practically poisoning myself and my family with bug sprays drain gel pine sol glue traps etc as well as waking everyone up constantly and driving them and myself crazy with my constant smacking of bugs against walls and a fair amount of swearing and shrieking  i also got the plugin sonic repellents — fyi dont  they dont work

i finally tried a this zapper  id held off because i just didnt see how a buzzing death chamber snapping randomly and doing nothing about the gazillion bugs flying everywhere would help  boy was i wrong  instead of choking on sprays and dealing with the sticky gross mess on everything and instead of one seat one kill we got dozens within a minute or two and i stopped freaking because bugs  plus theres a guilty pleasure in playing death tennis and hunting the hordes and making them suffer and die    okay maybe ive been hearing too many of my teens zombie games  still worth it

also i dont know if this brand is better or worse but the style — where it has the stand can be wielded like a racquet but also allows you to do so with it set to fullon rather than depress and hold down a switch each time you want to wield death is much easier to use  aging hands even just middle aged ones dont take well to carpaltunnel invocations

i do have one issue now though the racquet has developed one spot that is zapping continually without any bug there  i assume something tiny is stuck but am waiting for my electrician husband  ive no intention of poking at an electrocution device without knowing how to fully ensure there is no power in it at all

one last good thing to note 20 a racquet even if i had to buy a new one every month is still
less than i spent on the sprays  such healthier too — at least for us

"it works well but i had thought that it would be bigger the pictures certainly makes it look big but it is not
a bit expensive but it is good to use i have been using this for months without any issues the blue light mode is really good it actually works it does kill some insects but very few one problem i have with this is that if you keep it on while it is charging then it doesnt charge the battery it actually drains it slowly so if you need to charge its battery then you need to turn it off also it is not very comfortable to press the power button while killing it but you can just use the blue light mode insects as it automatically kills insects for you

this racket is a genius invention how can you actively kill mosquitoes while sleeping??? use this thing of course the purple glow gives a beautiful genlte illumination to the entire room when its dark its like a black light everything white and light coloured glows in the dark and well most importantly since i have had it in my room a few days now no more mosquitoes singing in my ear when you do see the critters flying use it as a normal hand held racket to smack them outta the air pop spark they gone  the charging cord was long enough to be conveniently plugged in unlkie other products these days coming with a ridiculously short usb cord like less than a foot charge progress leds helps you gauge the battery charge level,-,very good,-,-,very good

the bottles looked way larger and they fit on the palm of my hand my hand it 7×35

if i knew it would be this small i would have just bought a swiffer skullskullskull
the guy wasnt lying when he said it felt flimsy as heck

my floors arent finished well its an old house and we ripped up the carpet but we have never refinished them this is however the cleanest they have looked since we moved in

i use one of the bottles for a diluted murphys wood cleaner solution and the other for pure water the spray is more of a mist so im not worries ill over spray

for 20 bucks its not a bad deal but for 10 more i could have had a swiffer rolling on the floor laughingrolling on the floor laughingrolling on the floor laughing",-,very good,-,very good,very good
"i was upset at first due to no assembly or howtouse instructions theres actually more info in the amazon page than in or on the products box but its really not needed the product goes together only one way and how to attach the pad to the bottom of the mop head was only common sense
the assembly is more light weight than i like  meaning that scrubbing any tough places on the floor or whatever surface will take elbow grease and usage of your back
i also used this mop to clean the shower stall floor walls and glass doors and the bottom and sides of the tub as well as the surround in these usages having a lightweight mop is an advantage",-,very good,-,very good,very good
"i love this mop

ive been trying to find more sustainable ways to clean and swiffer was not cutting it i opted for this spray floor mop which i can refill and multiple pads for those deep clean days the pads are easy to clean and do a great job of cleaning the floor

sometimes you have to put your back into it for the more aggressive spots on the floor but with the right cleaning solution this mop can do it all",-,very good,very good,-,very good
"perfect for a tiny apartment with small floor space its compact and easy to set up and put together
the bottle is small and only hold about your standard water bottle in the amount of fluid but that is easy to work with in a space that requires only a little attention it came with a little detailing tool that can be used to clean the pads of hair before washing and i imagine the blades and hooked edge can also be used as scrapers for edging the floor with the silicone portion also kind of used as a scrubber
the thing is pretty handy and fits perfectly in storage in a small space because it itself is tiny
im a big guy so the thing is kinda tiny by comparison so my only criticism to it would be that it may be easy to manhandled into a broken state if your not careful
pictures show man hand holding the pump handle and the detailer be careful using the detailer to lift off the hairs or you might pull a seam on the pad thankfully you get three also remember that any left over solution in the bottle should be either dumped or the bottle should be removed and turned upside to avoid having any solution eat away at the rubber seal
i gave it four out of five solely because of its possible flimsy nature but that may not be honest in the future if it holds up to use definitely convenient and worth the money spent",very good,very good,-,very good,very good

"this mop is suuuupperrr small when it came i thought i was given a toy because of how small the box was face with tears of joy

the bottles looked way larger and they fit on the palm of my hand my hand it 7×35
they were soooo tiny

if i knew it would be this small i would have just bought a swiffer skullskullskull
the guy wasnt lying when he said it felt flimsy as heck

my floors arent finished well its an old house and we ripped up the carpet but we have never refinished them this is however the cleanest they have looked since we moved in

i use one of the bottles for a diluted murphys wood cleaner solution and the other for pure water the spray is more of a mist so im not worries ill over spray

for 20 bucks its not a bad deal but for 10 more i could have had a swiffer rolling on the floor laughingrolling on the floor laughingrolling on the floor laughing",-,very good,-,very good,very good
"i was upset at first due to no assembly or howtouse instructions theres actually more info in the amazon page than in or on the products box but its really not needed the product goes together only one way and how to attach the pad to the bottom of the mop head was only common sense
the assembly is more light weight than i like  meaning that scrubbing any tough places on the floor or whatever surface will take elbow grease and usage of your back
i also used this mop to clean the shower stall floor walls and glass doors and the bottom and sides of the tub as well as the surround in these usages having a lightweight mop is an advantage",-,very good,-,very good,very good
"i love this mop

ive been trying to find more sustainable ways to clean and swiffer was not cutting it i opted for this spray floor mop which i can refill and multiple pads for those deep clean days the pads are easy to clean and do a great job of cleaning the floor

sometimes you have to put your back into it for the more aggressive spots on the floor but with the right cleaning solution this mop can do it all",-,very good,very good,-,very good
"perfect for a tiny apartment with small floor space its compact and easy to set up and put together
the bottle is small and only hold about your standard water bottle in the amount of fluid but that is easy to work with in a space that requires only a little attention it came with a little detailing tool that can be used to clean the pads of hair before washing and i imagine the blades and hooked edge can also be used as scrapers for edging the floor with the silicone portion also kind of used as a scrubber
the thing is pretty handy and fits perfectly in storage in a small space because it itself is tiny
im a big guy so the thing is kinda tiny by comparison so my only criticism to it would be that it may be easy to manhandled into a broken state if your not careful
pictures show man hand holding the pump handle and the detailer be careful using the detailer to lift off the hairs or you might pull a seam on the pad thankfully you get three also remember that any left over solution in the bottle should be either dumped or the bottle should be removed and turned upside to avoid having any solution eat away at the rubber seal
i gave it four out of five solely because of its possible flimsy nature but that may not be honest in the future if it holds up to use definitely convenient and worth the money spent",very good,very good,-,very good,very good

"as someone who runs a small business i am always looking for highquality paper towels that are absorbent and convenient i recently purchased kleenexregistered multifold paper towels 01890 and i am very happy with my purchase

strength and absorbency
these paper towels are incredibly strong and absorbent they are able to handle spills and messes without tearing or falling apart i also appreciate how soft the towels are which makes them gentle on my hands

convenience
the multifold design of these paper towels is very convenient as it makes it easy to dispense a single towel at a time i also appreciate the fact that they come in a large quantity which means i dont have to restock as frequently

costeffective
these paper towels are costeffective and provide good value for the price they are affordable without sacrificing quality which is important for my small business

ecofriendliness
while i appreciate the quality of these paper towels i do wish they were more ecofriendly the fact that they are not made from recycled materials is a downside and i would prefer to see kleenex offer a more environmentally friendly option

conclusion
overall i would highly recommend kleenexregistered multifold paper towels 01890 to anyone looking for a strong absorbent and convenient paper towel option while they may not be the most ecofriendly option on the market they provide good value for the price and are ideal for small businesses or households",very good,very good,very good,very good,very good

i like this product its strong absorbent and you dont have to use so many to dry your hands or wipe up surfaces  but the price keeps getting higher and higher every time i buy them  about every 68 weeks i even tried a cheaper brand but those towels were rough thin and you had to use more of them so due to that im back with the kleenex brand hand towels but it is unfortunate that they keep raising the price,good,good,good,-,good
although i have tried different brands i have always come back to kleenexregistered multifold paper towels this name brand makes a different  you do not need multiple towels for one simple use like a quick wipe down  others have fallen apart or are so thin that it requires you to double up on a single sheet it is my complete goto be it drying hands or wiping frying pans  its imply durable and gets the job done without leaving a mess,-,good,-,-,good

"i first got a single dude shower wipe as a free sample at the supermarket and it filled a need that i didnt even know i had
i tried it out for the first time after i suddenly found myself needing to leave the job site to go to an appointment i had a clean shirt with me but not enough time to go home to shower well after following the directions on the package i wasnt clean but i was freshened up enough to put on a clean shirt without smelling offensive for my appointment and the appointment went well without anyone noticing that i hadnt showered yet so it passed the test with me

the instructions are simple enough when i explain how to use it i always tell them to start at the face and neck then hands the pits the sack and finish at the crack then stuff the dirty shower wipe back into the pouch until you can chuck it into the trash done now youre fresh enough to carry on until your next opportunity to properly wash
since i got my first free sample i have gotten more and i use the after work as well as on camping trips to refresh i didnt even know that i needed them until i got my first free sample and now i cant live without them i showed them to several friends who keep finding reasons to refresh while on the go i dont like calling them a shower but they do help a lot more than just walking around musky and offensive all day
yes i can absolutely recommend dude shower wipes to help you refresh between showers it works well for me and my needs so im confident that others can benefit from them
5 stars",-,very good,very good,very good,very good
im a delivery driver so i tend to get pretty sweaty throughout the day sometimes i have plans after work and dont really have time to shower or may not even have a chance to go home first these wipes are great for such occasions they allow me to freshen up enough to feel presentable and also get rid of that sticky feeling that sweating can leave on your skin the wipes themselves are thick and soft and moist enough to wipe your whole body down before drying out highly recommend these wipes for other folks with dirty jobs i think theyd also be great for traveling camping etc,-,very good,very good,-,very good
im a chick i sweat like a dude ive tried every wipe on the market because i hate getting into my car after boxing when im drenched but the gym bathroom is small and uninspiring so id rather shower at home these wipes allow me to remove my shirt completely wipe down my entire face arms and torso in about 30 seconds and put a fresh shirt on until i get home to shower this helps keep my car clean and i sit on a towel and avoid breakouts from the sweat drying on my skin in the 20 mins it takes to get home i think these guys did themselves a huge disservice branding these wipes for men and cutting their market in half considering they are fragrance free and there is nothing manspecific about them by the time a woman becomes a mom she buys wipes by the truckloads i was actively looking for “grown up” wipes for myself for the gym because wipes were a staple in my life so i feel like these “dudes” must know nothing about marketing or consumer demographics to box out 50 of the population just because they wanted a cheeky name nevertheless the product is terrific and i recommend them to ladies and dudes alike,-,very good,very good,very good,very good

this is the first time ive bought this brand dish soap its alright it smells nice as soon i opened the box i could smell the soap it was wrapped in plastic in a large cardboard box by itself so im assuming in transit the top broke off causing it to leak in the box one reason i decided to buy this dish soap was for the hand pump unfortunately i had to switch the bottle the packaging definitely needs more effort,-,-,good,good,good
it has no hints of citrus but it does clean my dishes well,-,-,-,-,-
i love the scent and it seems to get the dishes clean but i went through it twice as fast as a squeeze bottle i tried to be conservative with this but it still disappears the pump is nice if you hate having the top of the bottle caked with gooey soap but i think ill go back to the old way,-,poor,-,poor,poor

"i love that this one had metal poles to hold verses plastic like before it makes it more sturdy to hold however  that makes the top a little heavier the only con i have this time is you have to stand it just right to stay standing on a variety of surfaces ie carpet

no one likes cleaning toilets and we have 5 of them in our house  i figured id try this out on the two upstairs that get used the most  they definitely work and our toilets always smell fresh and look clean  the only issue is that the tube runs horizontal along the tank of the toilet  this has a tendency to choke the valve which decreases the amount of water that enters your bowl  after a flush you sometimes have to hold the handle down to let more water into the bowl  thats my only gripe it might not have that same effect on someone elses toilets as it did mine  overall im happy with it and havent had to add any tablets since i installed them now on both upstairs toilets,-,very good,very good,-,very good
great product keeps your toilet clean,-,-,-,-,-
we travel often and would find mold in toilet bowl after a week of being gone had started using bleach tablets but was informed by a plumber that they damage the internal parts of the tank kaboom uses the overflow tube to add bleach to the toilet bowl and doesnt affect tank parts works great at keeping bowl clean between regular cleanings and after extended absences,-,very good,-,-,very good
i wish dwight and church would make a refill box to save money per unit buying in small amounts has low value,very good,-,-,very good,very good
"were in new york so theres not as much hard water in our area the system was easy for me to install and the kaboom system legitimately kept our toilet bowl clean for a few months the only thing it could not defeat was our sons poop stain on the bowl dont know why lol everything else the bowl was kept clean when it was time to change the tablets wed notice the bowl starting to get a bit dirty

overall this was awesome we had to stop using it because our building changed the toilets and the system doesnt work with our style of toilet so unfortunate",-,good,good,-,good

always love getting new microfiber towels because their absorabance makes work effortless first time purchasing this brand i like the size of these not to big and not too small i also like how thin they are because it is so easy to wring out the water and clean i use one of the colors specifically for dusting you use it dry and it really traps the dust well like the colors so i can specific use a different color in kitchen and bath they seem to be holding up to washes and use so far please wash them properly without fragrance softener and separate from everything so far as good i would recommend them,-,very good,very good,-,very good
overall they work great they absorb well and do not leave spots however they are very thin and im not sure how long they will last after i start washing them often the package comes with a lot of them so if they do not last maybe this is no big deal again it is a good product and i would have given them a 5star if they were a little thicker other than this they are worth buying,-,very good,-,very good,very good

i really like the size of these cups along with the lids  i make pudding cups for my kids and grandkids  the lids prevent the pudding from getting a film on top  snacks are easily divided rather than reaching in the bag while traveling or at home  reduces the crumbs on the floor and carpet  there are so many uses for these cups  you cant put everything in plastic bags  because i am single i use these to portion out larger bottles and cans of food stuffs once they are opened  i also use them to store canned dog food because my doggies dont eat a whole can between them and dry dog food portioned out if i have to leave them with an animal care giver,-,very good,-,very good,very good

"these are my new favorite black nitrile gloves nitrile glove prices and availability went bonkers during covid  were now 23 years down the line and thanks to inflation things arent much better fortunately i found these gloves which are a great price and very good quality these have become my new favorite i dont even bother looking locally anymore i cant find a better glove at a similar or cheaper price any where in town i just order these and let our friendly amazon driver drop them off at our doorstep

these are very durable for the money i was so tired of the horrible quality gloves that rip when you try to put them on i was also tired of gloves advertised as black gloves that were gray or so thin they were translucent when they arrived these are very strong and theyre a true black which i really like

i use these mainly for workshop and automotive work theyve performed well for painting auto repair cleaning and more very rarely ill have a issue with one out of the box   sometimes ill get a rip when putting them on etc its 12 gloves out of a  box of100 if i have any issues at all i like these enough that i order multiple boxes at a time i wish they had a bulk buying discount they also work great for household cooking and cleaning

these are single use disposable gloves but theyre strong enough to withstand multiple uses if youre careful if im feeling very frugal i can carefully pull them off and reuse them for a second time  you cant do that with many of the cheap gloves on here

im a guy with large hands they measure about 425 wide at the palm and around 75 long from base of palm to tip of my middle finger i typically buy the xl and they fit me great ive also bought and used the l which are fine for my hands as well they just fit a little more snugly",very good,very good,very good,very good,very good

"i have been using these religiously for 3 years to bag dirty diapers and they are amazing
we bag soiled nappies and throw them in a kitchen size lidded garbage can outside of our backdoor this has worked so much better than using the diaper disposal systems and truly keeps the stink out of our house who wants to keep a poopy diaper inside until the can is full or waste a ton of expensive bags by bringing them out half empty?
baby specific bags cost 2x the  these bags are remarkable at masking the yucky odors and the corresponding dispensers hang perfectly from a diaper bag or stroller
we also use them for dog waste which is how i discovered their usefulness with our 2legged children

ive been purchasing these through the subscribe and save program since 2020 since then we recently recieved one delivery which lacked the normal quality the bags felt different than normal and seemed a bit thinner we used them and seemed to do the job but after using these bags 10x a day for years the change whatever that consisted of was absolutely noticeable",very good,very good,very good,very good,very good

i dont hardly use 9 volt batteries and yet they are so expensive it was stated during purchase that the shelf life of these energizer 9 volt batteries was 5 years but upon arrival it was dated with exactly 4 years and even if they were sitting on the shelf if used after their expectant life date they would not charge our window alarms and toys as theyd be mostly dead how do i know? i know because i had some outdated 9 volt batteries of the same brand still packaged and they would not work even though they still showed a little life left when tested with a battery tester they did not arrive in a single package of 8 as listed but in 4 separate 2 packs all dated the same with only 4 years of life expectancy left,bad,bad,-,bad,bad

"i have been sick of buying new bottles of name brand cleaner to put in my wetmops so i decided to get this without practice i put entirely too much cleaner in the bottle the first time and made my floor sticky but afterwards using a light mix of fabuloso or pine sol and some vinegar in water has helped keep my floors so much cleaner and at a fraction of the cost

the only nitpick i have is with the water sprayer itself it acts like a cheap spray bottle where i would love if it held pressure for longer and sprayed continuously somehow that said i do not know how you could make a mechanism like that in a mop and keep the price down so pulling the trigger more often is a worthy price to pay",very good,very good,very good,very good,very good

i used to think the play and charge kits would have saved me time and money but they have became more of a hassle in the long run not to s on microsoft by any means but their play and charge kits go bad a year or less the cable that comes with it has an led indicator that only when lit up is when the controller is officially charging which struggles to do so not long after owning it  to make matters worse the battery pack itself will be fully charged then only within 45 hours of usage will the battery become half full or less after dealing with these play and charge kit issues for the past several years i decided to quit lieing to myself forking up 2030 a peice for each play and charge kit and researched brand name bulk of batterys to save even more money because in my opinion the top brand names dont perform any better than store brand after some research i stumbled across these and gave them a chance thats gonna guarantee fully charged battery on demand the main focus was purchasing just the right amount that will last but also not expire which these should last me bare minimum 3 years of no headache,poor,poor,poor,-,poor

"this is a product every household should have in addition to the phone number of a good plumber an auger or snake some baking soda and some vinegar the key is not letting clogs get so out of control that you need professional intervention

prevention our tub and sinks have small close mesh wire drain covers which catches about 80 of hair and just about anything else once or twice a year we use this product in all our sink and tub drains as part of our regular cleaning we live in an older place and this product doesnt hurt the pipes the bottle says safe for all kinds a plumbing auger or snake very inexpensive comes in handy for temporary relief sometimes pouring baking soda down a drain and then some vinegar will help things move a bit it works like a reverse volcano almost but its rarely a cure

this product it may say to let things sit for a certain amount of time but you cant see how bad your clog is so i always leave it in a lot longer and use a different sink otherwise you may have to buy more bottles of this or call a plumber its not unusual for this to take more than one bottle to work but its still cheaper than a plumber theres no bad smell from this again safe for all pipes we let it sit a little longer than the bottle says it does not work well on standing water when best to use as part of regular cleaning when you first see things arent draining as fast the price point here is on par with the local hardware store and even target no complaints",very good,very good,very good,very good,very good

do i have a lab that has tested to see how much bacteria is left on these objects? no but it makes me feel better and my baby hasnt seemed to get sick from stuff at home  daycare was a different story i did spray some on my finger and tasted it prior to use to see if it would alter the taste of any of his thingsi tasted nothing and it doesnt seem to bother him",-,good,-,-,good

"these dishwashing gloves feel a little thinner than the ones i previously had however thats not a problem because these gloves are durable and because they are a little thinner i can feel my dishes through them and grip things better so i actually prefer them over the other ones i used to use

you get three pair in a pack so they are affordbalem and the colors are bright and cheerful i keep one pair in my kitchen one in my bathroom and the third pair as a spare",-,very good,-,-,very good
these gloves are pretty long they cover the expanse of your arm i also have some questions about the durability of them as they seem pretty thin in material so much so that you can feel the heat from hot water pretty clearly  as if there is no protection at all on your hands i use these for washing dishes to get my hands not from pruning up and it suffices in that regard but i am not super pleased with them,-,poor,-,poor,poor
these gloves fit well on smaller hands the rubber is thinner than i am used to so i still feel the heat from super hot water but so far the gloves have been durable and work just as well while providing good grip or feel for what i am washing,-,very good,-,-,very good
it fits me good but it is thin i am not sure not how long it can last,-,neutral,-,-,neutral
these are very nice rubber gloves i like that i could pick different sizes and i picked a medium they fit me well and arent too big on me most gloves run quite large but these are nice as they are my size no type of lining inside but they do not leak or seep in liquid as youre cleaning or washing dishes some gloves really dry out my hands even though im not touching any product these did not and did a good job,-,very good,-,-,very good

weve been trying to spend less money getting coffees smoothies etc so weve been making them at home these are the perfect way to make you feel like youre getting a treat when its something youve made at home the quality is excellent i gently hand wash and reuse and these hold up well would definitely buy again,very good,very good,-,-,very good

i thought these would be flimsy and cheap but they are strong and durable i used them for valentines  day goodie cups for a preschool class and replaced the straws with pencils i used vinyl to put names on the outside and they turned out amazing i am very happy with the quality of these,very good,very good,-,-,very good
great for iced coffee if you are trying to save some money doesnt hold a lot if its overfilled and no spillage with the lid,very good,-,-,-,very good

"my toddler loves his bigboy cups  overall we are very satisfied with the durability and over all sturdiness the colors are vibrant and he loves when we mix and match blue cup yellow lid green straw

id love to give it 5 stars but my son has figured out that if he turns it completely upside down it will drip slightly from the hole in the lid intended for the straw even when the straw is in place  im glad the straw is firmly held in place or we might have a bigger mess and i try not to fill the cup too high so when he does tip it upside down water wont come out through the straw  once he figured out he can make puddles on the table or floor and pretend to finger paint we decided we have to supervise him when using the cups  when on its side the cup does not drip though  trust my kid to find a leak in an otherwise leakproof object",-,good,-,-,good
not bad for the price the cups are sturdy  no leaks unless you tilt them upside down other than that its a great product,very good,-,-,-,very good
the bottoms of the cups have ridges that made me concerned theyd be a pain to clean  but so far ive had no issues the straws stay put so firmly that my kid can carry the cup by the straw good for the cost,neutral,neutral,neutral,-,neutral
"we like that the lids screw on so when theyre tossed off the high chair the lid doesnt come flying off and it minimizes liquid spills  its not leak proof so liquid will spill out especially if toddler holds cup upside down  the straws are hard plastic toddler being a toddler chews on the straws and they become flattened and makes sucking liquid through them more challenging i bought silicone straws that work perfectly to prevent this from happening

pros
screw on lids dont fly off when cups are thrown
reusable
easy for toddler to hold and use

cons
not leak proof
straws are not durable/toddler proof and can get ruined from toddler chewing/biting on them consistently",-,very good,-,-,very good
so much easier for my students than a pop on top the screw top makes it easier for it not to open up and the small opening makes it easier for my students not to spill or take the straw out too much,-,-,-,-,-
great size for our 4 year old fits in her hands well and like that the lids screw on vs pop on she likes the different colors but the straws arent the strongest so if your child bites on straws at all then you will go thru them quickly,-,good,-,-,good
we bought these for our toddlers so they can drink juice water etc we like them since they have a lid that screws on and they are easy to wash,-,-,-,-,-
affordable and what i expected they do leak a bit when tilted which isnt a problem because i just watch my daughter and correct her when she tried to tilt it too far back,neutral,-,-,-,neutral
with my arthritic fingers it is hard to roll my bud anymore so i invested in this lil tool here it works perfect took me about 2 tries to get it exactky right but boy does it take the pressure off of sore joints  it is mostly the way you roll your thumbs once you get that down then no problems i love it  it does come with an extra sleeve but unless you are torturing this device being heavy handed etc it should last for quite some time it does come with instructions but the only thing it does not say is when you put the paper in it is gum side facing you but you still roll it the same direction always towards you 5 stars across the board for me look at those perfect sausage rolls  also remember the 78mm is for 1 1/4 papers if you want to add filters etc you will need a longer roller  i use the job 1 1/4 and they work perfect,-,good,good,-,good

they work great if you use deep water wash on he washers they dont seem to work with low water levels the photos i posted are after using them when washing the blankets my cats sleep on as you can see in the deep water setting it actually caught a lot of fur in each one typical laundry loads i get very minimal lint caught in them if any at all,-,good,-,-,good
bought it but havent wear because its a very good looking all around just dont want to put it on the ground but will soon,-,very good,-,-,very good
the bad reviews almost stopped me from trying these out  you can see for yourself that the lint it removed from a small batch of towels was quite significant  when using an he top loader you do need to use deep water mode to allow these to float properly  not sure on the durability yet but i do hope they last,-,good,-,-,good

the gloves themselves are thick enough if you try to put them on and your hands are wet at all you will fail the gloves will stick and if you pull the gloves will tear at the wrist i always make sure my hands are completely dry

"let me start by saying that i recently purchased the zap it electric fly swatter racket  mosquito zapper and it was a real shocker literally this product is advertised as a highduty 4000 volt electric bug zapper racket but let me tell you its more like a highduty 4000 volt electric shock therapy racket

i first used it to swat a pesky fly that had been buzzing around my apartment for days i grabbed the racket and with a flick of my wrist i swung it towards the fly and then bam i heard a loud buzzing sound and saw a bright blue light as the racket made contact with the fly the fly was obliterated in a cloud of smoke and i was left feeling like i had just been electrocuted

now i have to say im not the bravest person when it comes to bugs so i was a bit hesitant to use the zap it on anything larger than a fly but i soon found myself feeling invincible with this thing in my hand i took on a mosquito a moth and even a spider with this electric racket of death each time i felt a surge of power as the bug met its untimely demise

however there were a few downsides to this product first of all the racket is quite large and heavy making it difficult to maneuver in tight spaces second the usb rechargeable feature is a bit of a pain you have to remember to charge it up before you use it and it takes a while to fully charge and finally while the yellow color of the racket is eyecatching it also makes it look like a giant toy

one thing that surprised me about the zap it electric fly swatter racket  mosquito zapper was how much fun it was to use it quickly became a game for me to see how many bugs i could zap in a single swing i even found myself inviting friends over to see who could swat the most bugs with the racket

but let me warn you its not all fun and games the racket is extremely powerful and i learned that the hard way when i accidentally touched the grid while it was still electrified lets just say i wouldnt recommend doing that unless you want to feel like youre getting tased

another issue i had with the zap it was the noise every time you swing the racket and make contact with a bug it makes a loud buzzing noise that can be quite jarring its not something that would bother me normally but after using it for a while i found it to be a bit annoying

finally i have to say that the zap it is not the most aesthetically pleasing product out there the bright yellow color is meant to make it stand out but it also makes it look a bit like a toy plus the shape of the racket is a bit awkward and not the most attractive thing to have lying around your home

as i continued to use the zap it electric fly swatter racket  mosquito zapper i found that it worked best on small bugs like flies and mosquitoes it was less effective on larger bugs like spiders which required multiple swats to take down

another downside to the zap it was the battery life it didnt last very long and i found myself having to charge it frequently especially if i was using it to zap a lot of bugs at once additionally the charging cable was a bit short which made it difficult to charge the racket in certain locations

one of the funniest moments i had while using the zap it was when i accidentally zapped myself while trying to turn it off i was trying to press the button on the handle to turn it off but i accidentally hit the grid instead lets just say it was a shocking experience pun intended

despite its flaws the zap it electric fly swatter racket  mosquito zapper did help me get rid of pesky bugs around my home it provided me with a sense of satisfaction every time i heard that satisfying zap and saw a bug disappear in a cloud of smoke its definitely not the most practical or convenient bug zapper out there but it gets the job done in a fun and entertaining way

in conclusion the zap it electric fly swatter racket  mosquito zapper is a mixed bag on one hand its incredibly effective at killing bugs on the other hand its a bit unwieldy and not the easiest to charge and lets be honest the bright yellow color makes it look like youre playing a game of oversized tennis so while i cant give this product a glowing review i also cant deny that it provided me with a good amount of entertainment 2 out of 5 stars  would shock again",-,very good,very good,very good,very good
the zap it bug zapper is precisely what we hoped it would be  we have had an unusual infestation of miller moths this spring this device has been the perfect remedy  we also have wasps that can be aggressive during the dinner hour on the patio and the zap it neutralizes them with one zap  the device holds a charge and so far is very durable  if you have a bug problem you will appreciate having at least one zap it,-,-,-,-,-
"i am prone to mosquito bites  theyll seek me out and tease me by flying in front of my face  i tested the product on house flies and zap  i heard the fly being zapped  so satisfying  they are lightweight and youll need to hold the yellow button in order to zap a bug  its not as big as i thought it would be but no complaints
negatives  if they are on a wall or on you youll need to wait until they are flying  i wish there were two cables to charge instead of one  i have one racket upstairs and the other downstairs",-,poor,-,-,poor
it definitely fries what gets inside the zapper  ive been using mine mostly on pantry moths and ive got to be careful they dont catch on fire  these would be great for use on mosquitos or house flies  i suspect theyd even get fruit flies but that season hasnt started here yet  it charges with supplied usb adapter  there is a switch so you can turn on the light if youd like when the power button is on  there is a button on the side above the on switch if you want to power up the zapper it might be a little awkward at first but its easy enough to hold it when gripping the handle  its very light weight for what it does and it is definitely effective  most people wont need the flashlight function but it is surprisingly effective at lighting up the targets,-,very good,very good,-,very good
we have a carpenter bee problem on our deck we tried a “black flag” branded aa battery zapper from lowes but it didnt stun the bees at all  junk  we returned it read about this brand of zapper and ordered from amazon this usb rechargeable version works fantastic  now we practice our backhand while protecting our home from pests  thank you zapit,-,very good,-,-,very good
it takes a few minutes to figure out how to use it but once you catch on its wayward hoe  you feel like you can accomplish anything  i found that if you go slowly you can zap these insects immediately what a charge that brings  i can see one fruit fly and zap 3 or 4 of them at once  its a blast  it is a little heavy at first but you get used to it  it actually works i see such a big difference in the amount that are flying around,-,very good,-,-,very good
it works really well on regular smaller flying pests but ill be honest the main reason i got them was for carpenter bees and they just laugh it off you zap/swat them they drop to the ground for a couple of seconds then fly up and away and back to destroying whatever wooden structure i was hoping to keep them away from theyll still be good for regular pests though so a great product to  be sure just not so much on carpenter bees so if youre hoping for some help with them youd do best to look elsewhere,-,very good,-,-,very good
"just received this pair of vaporizers and theyre awesome charged them up waited for a mosquito to get near me and pressed the red button the bug sparked and rattled around a bit before turning to dust the scent that followed reminded me of burning ants with a magnifying glass as a kid just some added fun without using chemicals and such
i might add im fighting the urge to touch this with my hand someone stop me hahaha",-,-,-,-,-

my boys 8yo and 5yo both have a pair i chose this particular goggles because it keeps their nose covered when under water they freak out if the tiniest of water gets in their nose and this goggles does a good job at keeping the water out the suction is decent im hoping that it lasts them a while seeing that the straps are adjustable will definitely recommend this product,-,very good,-,very good,very good
im cannot believe that ive waisted years and probably one hundred dollars on cheapo kids goggles that leak profusely when i should have just purchased these a long time ago  our eight year old is adamant about wearing goggles when she goes underwater and prefers this style where it covers the nose  however everything else we have tried leaks almost instantly and has a flimsy strap  these speedo goggles are legit and might cost a few dollars more but they are worth every penny for kids who like this style  they do not leak or fog when applied properly and the strap is solid  the strap can be adjusted easily by a kid without the need to pester the parents for help  i estimate these work for most kids ages 513  look no further if you want goggles that cover the nose,very good,very good,very good,very good,very good

"my favorite paper bowls they are sturdy which i love im gonna be honest i have not tried eating soup in these because i prefer to eat soup out of taller bowls because im clumsy and spill easily so i just use my real bowls for soup however i think these bowls could handle soup

i eat everything else out of these mostly without issue except sometimes if food is really hot the bottom of the bowl will get a little moist not to the point that it makes a mess but enough that its a little uncomfortable to hold if you eat in front of the tv or computer a lot like me so sometimes i double up the bowls im not worried the bottom is going to disintegrate and fall out if i dont double up i just like it to feel 100 dry when i hold the bottom also doubling up allows me to hold hot food easier without burning myself super nice

my only gripe is they used to ship these in a plastic bag and then the bag of bowls was in a box the last 2 times ive ordered these though they were only in a bag no box as a result some of the bowls were damaged in transit

if theyd just start shipping these in a box again that would be great",-,very good,very good,very good,very good

i have a cast iron skillet that was my greatgrandmothers i love using it and have had to remind my husband constantly that he cant clean it the way hes used to he wants to leave it soaking in soapy water for hours to loosen whatever debri may have gotten cooked onto the sides before scrubbing it with a steel wool pad he couldnt understand how he could possibly get it clean without lots of water and soap and soaking and scrubbing i had thought about getting a chain scrubber but know enough about us that we would misplace it very quickly this scrubber solves that problem it sits right next to the sink faucet and is always there when it arrived and i showed it to my husband and explained how it works he was almost as excited as i was it scrubs our pan quickly and easily and rinses well ready to go again,-,very good,-,-,very good
"i like this scrubber does an excellent job on my cast iron but when i received it the chain mail mail rings were all disassembled and just laying around in pieces i had to take a couple hours clamping each ring together with pliers and reconnecting all of it to the handle it comes with it worked fine once i did all that but i assume it was supposed to arrive in one piece  ready to work out of the box mine didnt arrive that way

"i recently purchased panasonics eneloop aaa 2100 cycle nimh rechargeable batteries and im extremely satisfied with their performance

these eneloop batteries provide consistent and reliable power for various devices whether its my tv remote wireless mouse and keyboard home medical equipment these batteries deliver a steady voltage output ensuring optimal device performance

one of the standout features is their exceptional longevity and ability to hold a charge while stored with an impressive 2100 cycle lifespan these batteries are a longterm investment the fact that they come precharged out of the package is a convenient bonus

panasonics expertise in battery technology is already recognized including their production of batteries for electric vehicles like tesla gives me confidence in the quality and reliability of these batteries knowing they are manufactured by a reputable brand and made domestically in its native japan further solidifies my trust in their performance the japanese electronics manufacturers make the absolute best energyefficient batteries and electronics in the world and my family has always unwaveringly trusted companies like matsushita panasonic and sony for decades for enjoying grim audio to home appliances i wish they offered the limited edition multicolorways and disney/sanrio character batteries as they do in japan  theyre so cute we always get the boring designs here stateside

the low selfdischarge rate is another advantage of the eneloop batteries even after months of nonuse in storage they retain a significant charge ready to power devices without any problems i have a dozen on reserve for emergencies

moreover choosing rechargeable batteries like the panasonic eneloop aaa contributes to a greener and more sustainable future by reducing the number of disposable lead acid batteries ending up in landfills these nimh cells last long and are not toxic to humans though they could be toxic to most plant life if not disposed of properly always follow the manufacturers guidance on proper disposal

in summary the panasonic eneloop aaa batteries deliver outstanding performance longevity and reliability their association with electric vehicle battery production highlights panasonics expertise i highly recommend these batteries to anyone seeking a dependable and ecofriendly power solution",-,very good,-,very good,very good
"ive been using eneloops for several years now and yet to have one fail on me my most recharged use for them is aas in my various xbox for my xbox 360 xbox one and pc controllers i keep 2 sets 4 batteries for each controller having one to play with while one recharges this has saved me countless money during this time and im still in awe of the amount of playtime between the need to swap sets ive also changed out every set of aa  aaa batteries in my house from controllers to remotes to scales to flashlights as soon as any device using standard batteries dies i replace the nonrechargables with eneloops

if you rarely swap batteries you may be fine with just doing what youre doing but if youre reading this review odds are you go through batteries at a steady pace and are tired of throwing money away seriously dont even think about it just buy eneloops my advice would be to get a starter kit with a charger a few aa  aaa options and some c  d sleeves the smaller batteries fit inside the sleeves to power the devices as there arent any c or d sized eneloops only smaller batteries in the sleeves which will work fine once you have a starter kit just pick up aa or aaa packs as needed to keep some on hand for when needed remotes seem to last forever with these so you will very rarely have to charge those i honestly cant recall having ever charged a set out of a remote items such as flashlights controllers or umm ladies nightstand equipment youd probably be wise to invest in 2 sets for each one use while another recharges

the price is higher but how much would you spend on batteries in 5 years? eneloops are insanely inexpensive when you look at things that way

seriously just go buy some i promise you wont regret it",very good,very good,very good,very good,very good
"this review is for the aaa 8 pack although much of the information applies to other eneloops

the batteries arrived packaged on a card as shown in the photo on this page i confirmed these are the latest 4th generation eneloop batteries as advertised  the date of manufacture is imprinted on every battery and although difficult to see i found this set was made 5 months prior to receipt

with any low self discharge battery lsd nimh one should perform an initial and periodic conditioning comprised of charging and discharging the cell 35 times in a charger that has this function sometimes called refresh in order for the cells reach their maximum energy storage capacity after conditioning  the aaa batteries all 8 exceeded 750mah capacity the advertised minimum with values ranging from 762mah to 778mah the very narrow range is an indicator of high quality and consistency in the manufacturing process

what follows are general recommendations to get the most from eneloop and other lsd nimh rechargeables
get a good quality charger if you use eneloops or other lsd nimh batteries cheap chargers will significantly shorten the life of these high quality and somewhat expensive rechargeable batteries the charger must be a microprocessor controlled smart charger that chargers each battery individually not in pairs i use a titanium smart fast charger when bulk charging many batteries and a opus btc2000 when trying to get accurate measurements on capacity and internal resistance these are there several others good quality chargers out there so be sure to read reviews from people who understand and discuss the technical aspects of battery chargers that 15 year old old battery charger you have that came packaged along with some long since thrown away rechargeable batteries should not be used

not all devices are designed to work with rechargeable batteries the nominal voltage of rechargable nimh batteries 12 volts is less than the alkaline equivalent at 15 volts some devices work well with either one and some are only designed for the higher voltage alkaline  this not a problem with the battery it is a problem with the way the device is designed unfortunately its rare for a device manufacturer to mention how or if it works with rechargeable batteries so you will have to test it or read the experiences of others

devices that display the amount of power left in a battery will be inaccurate when using rechargeables and tend to indicate the batteries have less power than they really do a device may show 2 out of 4 bars when in fact the eneloop might really be at 85 of charge

rechargeable batteries like eneloops lsd nimh store 2035 less energy than a good quality alkaline of the same size this is not a problem with the rechargeable battery it is a characteristic of the chemistry and how the energy is stored that means you can not expect them to last as long between charges as an alkaline before replacement in most applications lsd nimh batteries however do hold more energy and last longer than carbon zinc batteries aka heavy duty these are the really cheap batteries you may see at the dollar store or come prepackaged with low end flashlights

rechargeable batteries should not be over discharged as it will damage them  unfortunately its hard to tell exactly when the ideal time is to recharge so its better to stay on the safe side and recharge early when device performance starts degrading and not wait until its completely dead the best way to tell for certain is to test with a battery tester that measures voltage under load and recharge when the battery gets to about 11 volts  even some cheap battery testers can do this look for bt168d or for a more expensive one the zts mini 9r if all you have is a voltmeter recharge when the open circuit voltage at rest is about 122v

rechargeable batteries should not be charged too quickly as the internal heat build up will damage them  for aaa nimh it should take 25 hours to charge fully depleted batteries  if your charger goes from empty to full in 30 minutes it is either damaging or under charging the batteries

devices that automatically charge the batteries such as cordless phones or cheap solar lights are not a good candidate for eneloops these devices use dumb charging circuits and will likely overcharge the batteries shortening their life for these types of batteries you are better off with cheap nimh batteries that are not marketed as low self discharge lsd

devices that use a very small amount of constant power such as a battery powered clock might be better off with an alkaline an alkaline may only need to be replaced every 3 years in such applications where as the rechargeable may need charging in less than a year due to higher self discharge rate and lower nominal voltage you will need to test it to be sure and decide what makes the most sense

infrequently used low power devices such as a tv remote in a spare bedroom are usually better off with alkalines a high quality alkaline may last 5 or more years and the cost/benefit of an lsd nimh just isnt there be cautious of low quality batteries this these sorts of applications as the battery may leak after a couple of years

eneloops and lsd nimh in general are better than alkalines in high current applications an eneloop can move energy faster to the device than an alkaline examples where lsd nimh out perform alkalines are modern photographic flashes remote controlled cars/planes certain high output flashlights

marking your batteries is a good idea especially with you have many purchased at different times that all look the same i mark mine by putting the year/month i purchased them followed by a unique letter when i first get them i test their capacity and log it for future comparison even if you dont have the equipment to perform extensive testing just knowing when you purchased each battery can be helpful down the road

properly managed high quality lsd nimh batteries like eneloops will give a long life abused they will not do any better than cheap nimh batteries most of the complaints and bad reviews are from people who do not understand the limitations use them in the wrong application or who do not properly charge them correctly using rechargeable batteries takes some work and isnt for everyone but if you can deal with their idiosyncrasies they can save a lot of money in the long run",very good,very good,very good,very good,very good
"well this thing worked well until after it was out of warranty it made it about 15 months i live near the intracoastal waterway in florida and have mangroves nearby so 2 problems we deal with are mosquitoes and gnats this thing works very well on both of those pests on normal houseflies its about an 80 kill rate larger critters like the mud dauber wasps etc that infest the area are usually just stunned but at least it gives you time to stomp them or whatever

when the thing ultimately broke a couple of days ago it has been working less than optimally for a while i disassembled it im a retired electronics engineer to peek at the inside what was physically broken was a tiny plastic tab that holds the back/bottom of the actuating switch from moving away from the pushbutton this little plastic widget was brokenit is very small less than an 1/8 in diameter and it takes the full pressure of the button being pushed each time the unit is used i found a suitable sized machine screw and epoxied it to take the place of the little plastic tab which worked however the high voltage generator circuit seems to have failed as well i never bothered testing the unit before it failed so i have no idea how much voltage it is supposed to generate but now after my tinkering it seems to be putting out about 515 volts dc on the wires in the grids it still kills mosquitoes but the satisfying crack is gone so my guess is that the high voltage generator is probably a bit sick after so much use leaky capacitor whatever

with all of that said im going to buy another one simply because it does work well on the majority of the critters that annoy me around here

just a couple of tips get a real dpst pushbutton switch as a replacement for that jury rig spst switch with the addon contacts anchor the switch better that little post is bound to fail before the rest of the unit and that means that the 20 bucks you charge is basically for that one failureprone component


update

well this second unit lasted about the same amount of time it failed with exactly the same problem as the first one the electronic engineering is very good until they get to the operators switch at that point it really and truly begins to draw a laboratory grade vacuum they use a truly weird little flat piece of tin which has a wire soldered to it and that is haphazardly mounted to what has to be the cheapest switch manufactured in the world a square hole punched to accommodate the square switch actuator when you push the button on the side you effectively close a dual pole single throw spring loaded switch the catch is that this switch is not attached to anything mechanically so each time you push the button on the outside youre pushing the whole switchwhich would be okay if the switch was mounted in a way that kept the switch locked in position but there is nothing but a tiny plastic post that goes up between the electrical poles on the switch and after some number of pushes it breaks the pushing the switch does absolutely nothing the high voltage supply doesnt get activated and the switch just floats around so im gonna order another one because it does work but im also going to try and come up with a small dpst switch from a reputable switch company and dremel tool the old mounting junk out of the way and put in a good switch

bottom line it works but it has a lifespan and that lifespan is measured by how often you use the thing each press of the actuator is a little bit of life gone

2nd update today as i got ready to buy another one of these i noted that the price has almost doubled to 5300  this is not worth 5300 not during this lifetime it was a stretch at 2900 there is perhaps 3 bucks worth of electronic components on one supercheap circuit board and maybe 2 or 3 bucks worth of plastic bits and pieces  if the switch had been completely reworked and a good micro or switchcraft switch installed it might be worth it but no just no not for something i know is going to fail  ill try one of the other brands and see how that goes",bad,bad,bad,-,bad

 i got tried of chasing these things flying around kitchen and living room in the evening and half the time theyre higher than i can reach and kill  if you dont kill them they can lay eggs  up to 400  and youll never get rid of them  so i broke down and bought this thing  wow im thrilled  one of those buggers hatched and came out tonight and zap it hit the wired and boom instantly fried the critter you saw it light up and crackle then disappear  it was instantaneous  cant wait to try it out on flies yellow jacket or hornets come summer  to activate it theres a button on the handle you keep depressed  it lights up red  when you swat at the flying insect release the button and the juice going to the wires are deactivated  you must keep the button depressed to keep it on and active  im sure was designed that way for safety purposes  takes 2 aa batteries  not included  you cant get much simpler than this  i can see why its named  the executioner 
be careful using this around kids or pets  and i wouldnt suggest trying it out by touching it either especially if youre in bare feet standing on wet grass",-,bad,bad,bad,bad

"i had the charcoal companion handheld bug zapper gifted to be a few months ago i first thought it was a gag gift and it sorta was but it turned out to be much more useful than i expected we dont have a huge fly problem in our house but every now and then someone leaves a door open and that pesky fly just wont find its way back out the charcoal did a fine job when it touched the flies or spiders moths whatever the keywords there are when it touched let me tell you this thing was not a fly swatter it was so flimsy and poorly built that when you tried to do a swatting motion the thing would creek and break the plastic was so thin that it would literally break due to the force of a swat i had to wait til flies landed which could take a long time sometimes to attempt to zap them one day i was trying to slowly swat a fly and the entire top half snapped off so fast forward i bought the executioner

i bought this because i saw the reinforced design and read reviews of better zapping power the design so far has been an extreme improvement over the charcoal i can swing this thing like a bat or a real tennis racket and it wont make a sound or feel like its going to snap in half now onto the part you want to know does it kill bugs? well heres where my review title comes into play it is a zapper it claims to zap bugs and let me tell you the sound and the spark are big and epic the style is all thereunfortunately just zapping the bugs didnt always mean it killed them if you swat at a fly and see and hear the zap and fly dropped somewhere that you cant find the chances of the fly coming back in a few minutes is highly likely

i still have to wait for flies to land most of the time so i can zap them and then continue to zap them to ensure that they die man that sounds evil i did a test to make sure that there werent just more flies coming in i trapped a fly in between my window and screen i zapped it once and it fell down i closed the window and waited for about 4 minutes and sure enough the fly was back on its feet it wasnt flying but it was crawling around still pretty dazed

if you are not as cruel as me and you want to only zap and get rid of the fly like throw it outside or something then this product will suit you just fine zap it once put it in a napkin and toss it back outside simple buy this now its great

but if youre like me and prefer it dead first time then maybe you need something else? i kept this product and gave it 4 stars because i love the build quality and dont find it a very big hassle to continue zapping the bugs however for other people looking for the one and done approach maybe this isnt for you

i do recommend it though for anyone who wants flys to at least stop bothering them whether permanently or otherwise

5 stars for build quality and zapping power 1 star becauseits a zapper not an executioner",-,very good,very good,very good,very good

i got these and soon found out that part of the sturdy is due to a ridge running down the center of the knife so while they are sturdy and cut through softer food items well i have not tried then to cut meat so far only bagels and the like the other thing i use them for is to spread butter peanut butter etc  that ridge makes that far more irritating as the ridge ends up holding portion of the spread and makes me dig it out  i would have preferred a flat blade but i bought 400 of them before i realized the ridge was there so i make do with it,-,poor,-,-,poor
they are plastic forks,-,-,-,-,-
the spoons are perfect  i purchased them for a specific purpose  no they wont be good for ice cream or even making a peanut butter and jelly sandwich  i purchased them to stir hazelnut coffee creamer into my coffee and to stir splenda into my homemade ice tea and splenda into my homemade ice coffee  my wife and i drink a lot of both hot and ice coffee  i also drink a lot of ice tea  the spoons are lite weight and not designed for heavy duty  also the price is excellent  i paid 1200 for 400 spoons  walmart charges 1900 for 400 although the spoons are more heavyduty so it is not strictly a fair comparison  so they are perfect for my needs,very good,very good,very good,very good,very good

"after receiving these minitorches yesterday and getting them filled with butane i am still sitting here kicking myself for not finding them years ago  why?  because i passionately hate wasteful and environmentally irresponsible consumer items like disposable lighters which all too often dont even work well out of the box and tend to produce a frustratingly weak flame even if/when you can get them to light  i am not a smoker but i do cook with charcoal burn yard debris in my fire pit on occasion have a woodburning fireplace and enjoy candles in the house so keeping a lighter around is a must  i also occasionally go camping and need a lighter with me for that

from what i can see so far unless these minitorches these are definitely not just lighters fail mechanically at some point they will last a very long time  the hefty feel in the hand and the quality of the aluminum construction are impressive and suggest durability  the slider switch that actuates the igniter and flame seems precise positive and consistent  the flame adjuster is convenient and designed so that it can never get bumped or changed without the full intention of doing so  the adjustment range for the flame is broad for a variety of uses and the flame is a literal jet that burns a steady and pure bluehot  mine adjust from a steady blue whisper that you can barely see to a pretty noticeable roar with the blue jet shooting out nearly 4 inches on the wide open setting  for my needs it will be most precise and useful at about 1 3/4 inches which of course will also conserve fuel

my first test with the new lighter was to light a heavy craft paper bag in my chimneystyle charcoal lighter  i had often struggled to do this with a normal barbecue lighter due to the weak flame and sometimes even the dry paper didnt want to stay lit especially if it happened to be breezy that evening  well im thrilled to report that the maiden use of my new minitorch effortlessly blasted right through the breeze and had my fire roaring in seconds  the blue flame it produces is much hotter than a wimpy lighter  what a welcome and refreshing change from the countless i wonder if its still lit barbecues of the past  it turned out to be a timesaver because i didnt need to run in and out of the house checking on the coals  i could see the dancing flame from inside the house within a minute of lighting  big success  again why didnt i get these before now??

as you can probably tell i already love these minitorches  the design is excellent and i think generally safe for any purpose i could put it to  the slider is not child proof but being an adult i am very happy that i dont have to deal with any such inconveniences  i cant say how hot the tip might get if the torch were used for something other than just a quick lighting of candles or burn materials but so far the tip has not gotten warm at all for me  i checked it just now and it actually seems to stay cool with normal use  i easily give this item 5 stars and i like the minitorches so much i may even be giving them as gifts from time to time

if i had one little nitpick it would be that id prefer to see more color choices because the black ones i bought arent easy to find in lowlight situations  but thats just a hint to the seller and certainly not a dealkiller for me  i could see the anodized aluminum in silver green red blue orange gold and purple all being popular offerings in addition to the black and all would be easier to find around the house or in the dark

i will update if there are any premature malfunctions or changes in my experience but i have already confidently cleared all the dead or nearly dead lighters out of the house never to be purchased again  good riddance to that endless stream of wasteful junkforever  buy these take good care of them and i think they will serve you well for years to come  dont forget to buy the butane which lasts a long time and comes in a recyclable can",-,very good,very good,very good,very good
"you cant beat this deal if you have any use for a small torch lighter its definitely worth it the last guy who
 reviewed it said they were no good it
 he couldnt get it to light well just so you know there is a small valve that the bottom of the lighter way you fill it you have to turn it upanddown to adjust your flame to high it wont light to low it wont light but when you get a just right its great lighter it is made of aluminum throughout doesnt appear to be any plastic on it daily thing i can say is the downsize? it runs out pretty quickly but definitely worth it to tank is in that big to keep the size of the lighter down to a minimum but the lighter is at least 6 or7 inches long? definitely fits in your hand very nicely i would highly recommend it",-,very good,-,-,very good
"i bought this as a 2 pack a year ago one of the two i use significantly more than the other i use it to light something at least twice a day and have used it for cooking to keep direct heat like a mini cooking torch as well i also use it as a torch to start propane wok hobs and direct heat on wood to start a charcoal smoker these have stood up well

i only encountered my first issue tonight after a year of heavy use and it was that the spark ignighter wasnt working turns out the end of the spark circuit was pulled up and it was sparking to the outer casing if you find yours stops lighting inspect the copper ignighter coil and maybe bend it down towards the fuel nozzle it will return it to normal functionality

"these are made from a weighty metal so they feel solid and of good quality however i initially had trouble getting these to work i reached out to topkay using the contact info in their instructions but they never responded

if you make the same mistake i did the poor quality butane can be removed and replaced  search online for how to bleed butane from lighter

before filling the first time be sure to hold down the lighter fuel inlet valve until the hissing stops turn the / dial all the way to low toward  fill following butane canister instructions then turn the / to high before trying to light the flame can then be adjusted to a lower setting using the / dial

these gloves are pretty long they cover the expanse of your arm i also have some questions about the durability of them as they seem pretty thin in material so much so that you can feel the heat from hot water pretty clearly  as if there is no protection at all on your hands i use these for washing dishes to get my hands not from pruning up and it suffices in that regard but i am not super pleased with them,-,poor,-,poor,poor

"this cleaning brush is an excellent choice for anyone who wants to make their cleaning tasks easier and more efficient

one of the best things about the mabogu electric spin scrubber is its cordless design which allows you to clean without being tethered to a power outlet this makes it perfect for cleaning hardtoreach areas such as shower stalls bathtubs and tile floors

the scrubber also comes with eight replaceable brush heads each designed for a specific cleaning task these brush heads are easy to replace and can be used for a variety of surfaces including tile grout and even carpets

another great feature of the mabogu electric spin scrubber is its powerful motor which spins the brush heads at a high speed to provide excellent cleaning power the scrubber also has an ergonomic design which makes it comfortable to hold and use for extended periods of time

overall i would highly recommend the mabogu electric spin scrubber cordless cleaning brush with 8 replaceable brush heads to anyone who wants to make their cleaning tasks easier and more efficient its cordless design replaceable brush heads and powerful motor make it an excellent choice for cleaning a variety of surfaces and its ergonomic design ensures that you can clean comfortably for as long as you need to",-,very good,very good,very good,very good
i wanted something like this for a long time only because im not so young and spry anymore and so having something that does all the scrubbing has made my life so much easier i used it on my bathtub and on my steps and walkway it worked like a dream removing all the build up shampoo and condition and the algae outside my steps have never looked better and my back is still in one piece  do yourself a favor and get this if just to physically help with every day cleaning,-,very good,very good,-,very good
im happy to have found this scrubbing tool it has helped to not break my back while cleaning the bathroom the multiple heads just snap on and pull off making changing them out to be an easy task with the different types and styles of cleaning heads this wand will be a great tool to use for many different cleaning tasks the battery has a decent life  the wand is adjustable in length and the head can be angled or straight im thankful to have found this,-,very good,-,-,very good
"this scrubber has been one of the best things ive gotten in a while  i have some pretty intense lower back pain bending over and scrubbing my shower was usually quite the chore for me but this electric scrubber allows me to stand upright since the handle has an extension and im 6ft tall so its a good size keeping my back from getting angry and inflamed
the corner brush is my favorite since it cleans the 90 degree angles on the tub awesomely  the charge lasts way longer than i need to clean the bathroom so i now love this brush more than most things in my house  its also built really well and isnt flimsy feeling at all the pieces go together very tightly",-,very good,-,-,very good

this actually works it works best on mosquitoes since they tend to hover or fly slow also works on killing flies if you can get them great arm workout and hand eye coordination practice when there are a bunch of flies fun to hear them hit the electric metal,-,very good,-,-,very good
we have friends who have these and i dont know if weve just bought the wrong brand or what it just doesnt work as well as we like i think thats because of the shape the ridge around where the screen mesh is is high so you cant get a flat zap on a fly thats on a solid surface occasionally a fly gets stuck on it and the smell is pretty bad the best way it works is if we use a regular fly swatter to show a fly into the zapper,-,very good,-,-,very good
these are wonderful i have 8 stray/rescued/now permanent house cats their food occasionally draws a few fruit flies during the hot summer months these work so well and i learned that you must keep fresh batteries in them even though the light was still red they got to the point that they didnt seem to be killing anythingso i thought that those type of reviews had a point then by chance i decided to put in new batteries wow pop pop pop again so if these work and they seem to stopchange the batteies,-,very good,-,-,very good
it worked well i had this big fly that kept flying me is now in fly heaven,-,very good,-,-,very good
the product is great however was far too big for my household would recommend for a large fly problem,-,good,-,-,good
this is easy to use and it works cant speak to how durable it is so far so good,-,very good,-,-,very good
i may update however the holes in the racket are much too large to get fruit flies  some of the other reviews i saw mentioned “if you can catch it”  i know how silly i looked trying to catch the one fly arms flailing finger trying to keep the trigger down standing up moving around for yes one fly zany face i didnt get it still here somewhere laughing at me and waiting for another go round  on that note its ironically fun,-,-,-,-,-
so technically it does what it describes but i wish it were a little more powerful,-,-,-,-,-
i love having a scented trash bag that it is durable and sturdy makes it a great choice for me most of all i prefer the slider closure over the zip style i find the slider much easier to use and much more reliable i can count on it to stay closed and not pop open as zip types can do i feel more confident that it will not rip or tear with a heavier load as i carry these bags to the trash bin i love having a fragrant bag in my garage or kitchen thats why i use these hefty bags any place i need to collect waste and will continue to use them,-,very good,-,-,very good

unsure if maybe our batch we got just happened to be a little defective or not we had put some soup that needed to be tossed into the bag and when we went to take the bag out to the garbage there was a big well spot in our can there was no hole in the back though so i am thinking it seeped through the pours in the bag that is why i took a star off other than that these bags are great because the hold a really good amount of stuff inside of them and the smell is amazing this is the best smelling trash bag i have come across and i have used many scented ones i usually prefer no scent but this smell has won me over even though this bag does not do well with liquids i think they are priced great and will be continuing to get them,very good,very good,-,-,very good

i got these to save money on plastic straws unlike some buyers my case was intact and fine i do suspect though that with the cheaply made plastic the latches wont last long the straws did have quite a few choices some straight some bent at the top there were also choices of size or thickness too i did find them to be shorter than expected i have a metal 17oz water bottle and the longest straws were maybe one inch over the top of the opening so if youre using this for a larger bottle you might need something else i do admit these are sturdy strong and i found no rough or sharp edges a good deal at the price,very good,very good,-,very good,very good

"firstly this listing seems to have the very same images and reviews as the angel soft version i bought the blue industrial one and that is what i got there is no core

tl/dr  good stuff for the money does the job and no pilling went from new roll everyday to 2 a week reliable

like a lot of people i gave this a shot because it was what i could get when the rona panic hit  personally i would keep using it just because i get tired of being the only person in the house who can change a roll sadly i am not the only one here apparently i have sturdier bits than the rest of my family  they dont care for the lack of softness its not nasty its just not plush it is smooth its better quality than a lot of commercial styles you would find if you went into a bathroom in a lot of stores that have a bathroom

pros  less changing the roll seriously if you live in a household where the mechanics of roll changing is beyond the rest of your housemates this is for you i used to have to change the roll daily now its twice a week i say i because it was and still is pretty much always me
it does its job its not super plush but not rough
it is strong enough not to shred when you pull on it
it does not pill up if you know what i mean
economic and also pandemic friendly
its easier on older toilets or plumbing challenged homes not saying anything about septic dont know our toilet is old and cant always flush all the way big fat fluffy tp always gets stuck this does not

cons  the hole is tiny you will need a special spindle reasonably priced and sturdy or a new tp stand if yours is too narrow i started with a chincy stand from wallyworld but it broke plastic pos i have since  bought a wooden stand that can hold this or the forever type rolls  the reason being is my bathroom has a ceramic tp holder and its too tight to hold the full roll even with the spindle so if you have an old dispenser you dont want to remove you will need to come up with a different arrangement
the package is huge if you have lots of space no worries if you have a small home it will be harder to find a place for the big brick o tp btw mine came as pictured blue and no holes and no issues and no box
it isnt frufru if your parts cry when you wipe with anything but a cloud this isnt for you especially the last wrinkly yard of the roll

i think that sums it up if you are not sure dont buy it because its a lot i started this package in midapril  i think i still have 3 or 4 more weeks left you could always donate if you dont like it  that said if you want decent reliable big fat hardly change it rolls this is the stuff for you",bad,bad,-,bad,bad
ordered these for 2 butts during the great plague of 2021 now i expected prison rolls that would be horrible this stuff is great for your septic safe wiping needs they even have a quilted version that i ordered for the wife because she yelled at me now i have over 30 rolls and enough tp for any level of taco bell they even hat serial numbers on them so you can assign them to your kids  friends and random people on the street,-,-,-,-,-

"since people are still panicbuying toilet paper it is currently only available at our small citys walmart / grocery stores early in the mornings when the stores first open  hopefully this will soon change but so far one cant buy toilet tissue in the afternoon

we are retirees who like to sleep in as opposed to stumbling around walmart blearyeyed at 600 am on senior day so we decided to try the convenience of having a 36roll case of gp tissues delivered to our door  we also bought the georgia pacific spindle the 50030 model so we could use the gp paper in our current wall tp holders  we had to buy the spindles on ebay since amazon does not offer them i got two for 1604  they work just fine and the gp tissue rolls fit better in my existing holders than fluffedup charmin mega rolls

i am pleased to report that the gp tissue definitely works as intended  granted it is not as thick as the charmin mega roll tissue we prefer but it is not bad tp at all  in my 40 years of working for fortune 500 companies ive had occasion to use the toilet paper in their restrooms literally thousands of times  the gp tissues are definitely equal to the tissues those companies provided  it is not rough it hold together and it allows me to clean myself completely  it is much better than the huge singleply rolls some businesses offer today

moreover the gp rolls are a very good value for the money  even if my wife needs to use a few sheets more per time to get the same drying effect as charmin the gp rolls are 1000 sheets as opposed to the charmins 286 sheets per roll  i havent bothered to run the numbers but i am pretty sure that even when one figures in a few more sheets of the gp tissue vs charmin every use we are still coming out ahead moneywise",very good,very good,very good,-,very good

"my bathroom sink drain was smelling really bad i couldnt figure out where the smell was coming from at first i definitely blamed it on my kids but after deep cleaning the bathroom and the smell getting worse i pinpointed the sink
i took the catch drain thing apart underneath the sink cleaned it out bleached it and thought i was good to go after putting it back together

nope 2 days later it was smelling again
thats where these magic sticks come in holy sht these made the smell go away quickly and easily and no mess

now this isnt like a one and done type thing but all i have to do when the smell comes back usually around 3 weeks is pop a new one in my sink
is there a better way for fixing the root cause of my sink? probably

"i didnt even think that a mop could be so small granted i am 64” but as others have pointed out even if i were 5 tall it would still be too short

like i said it does work but having to be bent over completely to use this is pretty unacceptable for how much it costs obviously i dont really have a choice but to keep it but im incredibly disappointed

edit  i am just dumb while the mop doesnt make it clear it actually expands at the handle and the head this makes it plenty long enough for tall people so hopefully other people who have left reviews with the same complaint will see this

the head of the mop is still a bit small and it takes a little bit longer than what should be necessary to finish a floor and that is why i give it 4 instead of 5 still a great mop though",good,good,good,-,good

"cleaning generally and in particular the scrubbing of bathrooms and getting on your knees becomes more difficult as you get into your fifties my husband saw this tool and thought we would try it out
pros
we like it generally it is particularly useful for quick maintenance of face basins tubs and bathroom tiles all the brush attachments will help you do that
easy to assemble and disassemble
love the fact that it extends so that you can maintain an upright posture
easy to clean
not sure yet about the battery life during continuous use did not see that in the material however i have used it over 30 minutes already and it was not fully charged
cons
this is not for commercial use when i attempted to apply some pressure to remove stubborn build up the motor stopped happened several times
i wish that you could plug the battery unit directly into the motor unit so that you get some action like a hand held drill
i wished the motor was more powerful and had several settings to raise the rpm further
maybe a larger scrubbing brush 810 for doing floors generally
conclusion
all in all not a bad product",-,very good,very good,-,very good
"what i love
it is light weight it came with instructions it was easy to assemble easy to charge telescoping pole makes less bending works wonderfully on my ceramic tiled shower and gets those corners really well
what i wish was better
i wish it had a swivel head the assembly is in such a way that the cleaner has to be held at an angle to lay flat so i still have to bend over which is taxing on my back however it gets the job done quickly so not much of an issue  just a wish",-,very good,-,-,very good
this helps me scrub my shower rather well  depending on the brush head and speed i had a bit of an issue holding onto and controlling it  slowing it down and switching scrubbers made it much easier to handle  the charge lasts a fair amount of time and it saves me some serious elbow grease and back bending  i do wish that it had a flexible head to get into tight corners,-,very good,very good,-,very good
i was getting tired of scrubbing our shower stall on my hands and knees so i bought this unit hoping that it would do the job without me having to manually scrub the stall and getting down on my hands and knees  i am impressed that it does the job reasonably well and the battery pack when fully charged allowed me to do the job without the unit losing any power  granted it only took me about 20 minutes total but i still was impressed  for a small lithiumion battery it provides a good amount of power thru the motor although a couple of times the motor stopped due to the heavy pressure i was exerting on the power head to scrub the floor  and although the brush heads do a good job the corner brush is already starting to show a little wear after only one use due to the stress of using it to scrub the edges and corners  allinall i think that this a good product and i am happy with it,-,very good,very good,-,very good
i bought this with the intention of using it to clean the bathroom shower and tub the brushes are too hard to clean without scratching the description states it will not scratch the tile i did a light scrubbing to prevent scratches the spin heads however are perfect for linoleum floors and i will use them for this i will continue to research spin scrubbers that have a more soft head brush the brush heads are way too stiff to scrub without scratching the tile i dont care what the description says please use some common sense if using it to clean your tile,-,very good,-,-,very good
i cannot believe i didnt have one of these all my life my least favorite chore in the world is scrubbing the tub i immediately notified my adult kids they need one of these in their life didnt even break a sweat cleaning the tub and it did a great job spay the cleaner and scrub done i will say dont push to hard with the brush as it will slow the spinning down but you dont actually have to push down harder for it to work its just instinct to do so i guess lol,-,very good,-,-,very good
i really love this products it helps so that i do not have to get on my knees to scrub i wish it would bend to help with getting easy in corners the smaller head for the corners bristles get frayed during first use that is the only reason i did not give 5 stars,-,very good,-,-,very good
this review falls under the category of you know youre old when  but yes here i am reviewing a cleaning product  i actually think i saw this specific one advertised on tiktok i rarely fall victim to clickbait but this was just so practical and life changing so i came to amazon to check it out and bought this one there were similar items several to choose from but i liked the accessories this was a good value and it was delivered next day speed was crucial so i didnt just lose interest in cleaning my shower before delivery the wand uses a usb charger but came partially charged  i charged it a little longer then cranked it up  i have a standup tile shower with fiber glass floor and glass doors  i tested each of the tools and they all worked very well on all surfaces  i really like the corner tool to get into all the grooves and difficult narrow spaces  my shower looked sooo much better afterwards  i am very short so the extendable handle really helped me reach the high and low places without killing my back those of you who like to clean will like this tool and those of you like me who hate to clean will really like this tool  it actually does work really well,very good,very good,very good,-,very good
"ive used a similar plugin bug zapper before and it works great whats special about this one in particular is that its completely cordless as it has a rechargeable battery

it can be recharged via the builtin solar panel on the top of the unit or using the included usb c cable

because its completely cordless its super convenient you can bring it outside with you on the patio or deck and place it somewhere out in the yard a ways to keep mosquitoes away from you theres also a builtin metal handle that doubles as a hanger

pros
cordless rechargeable battery
lightweight
attracts insects very well
easy clean bottom cap unscrews
doubles as a latern with 2 power levels and can be used independently of the blue light zapper function

cons
the only con i can think of is that it can only charge up to 65 via solar in a day

youd need to let it charge longer than a day or use the usb charger to hit 100",-,very good,-,-,very good
this product is what i was looking for i wanted a solar power bug zapper with an optional ability to charge we have used several times at dark and cloudy days i was never bitten by a mosquito it is quiet i was wondering if it was working and saw all the bugs dead on it it works it has a handle that you can hang it from if desired we just sit ours on the outside table it is very lite weight good investment for us i would recommend well designed for multiple uses,-,very good,very good,very good,very good
i got this for mosquitoes and knats that get into my bedroom this is a reoccurring issue i have this is a nicer model than the ones i use in the office that are on 247 i like that i can hang it on a closet knob and that it has a regular light to turn on to see when its dark thats a bonus i keep it on the charger and the blue light works to get them while i sleep while its nice that it can be used outside using the solar charging capability i am using mine in my bedroom and for a night light when i need it and i can hang it on a closet knob,-,very good,-,-,very good
as a zapper it does well butive yet to receive more than 4 hours from usb charge and two hours from full sun exposure  maybe this will improve on solar but i charged via an ipad block for two hours and againgot four hours  as a zapper its exceptional but the cleaning brush wont last long with cheap bristles  i would buy if its on sale again just for the option of being able to take it with me to other points of the yard,poor,poor,-,-,poor
my wife and i really love these solar powered bug zappers they double as lanterns so we have a bright light when i need to see and the bug zapper works very welli was surprised at how well it works its as good as the plug in ones,-,very good,-,-,very good

its not as powerful as a plug in but its does its job i am pleased with it",-,-,-,-,-

"first off
ive used many different bug zappers and they just didnt  measure up to this bug zapper

we had to start using clear bags for our green waste trash pick up clear bags werent available in any of the local stores i was pleased to find several options at amazon after much research and reading reviews i decided to get these bags they are reasonably sturdy and work well for leaves and light twigs an occasional larger twig poked through the bag but for the most part they worked very well and seemed to be suitable for lawn waste,-,good,-,-,good
will buy again and again,-,-,-,-,-
pleasantly surprised is the term id use to describe how i felt using these bags the first time i bought them was instore they were super cheap at the time id decided to start taking out my kitchen trash every dang night as my curious dog kept tipping over the trash can it felt wrong to throw out a tall kitchen bag while it was only 1/4 full so i opted for these smaller bags my criteria were simple small cheap and fit my current tallkitchen 13 gallon trash can i was not particularly concerned with durability or sturdiness these bags are indeed quite thin they are not as durable or sturdy as typical tall kitchen bags but they are perfect for oneday use in the kitchen or oneweek use at your desk be wary of throwing away sharpcornered flattened boxes if the bag is relatively full  as for fitting my existing trash can they do the bags are constructed with a single pinch point at the bottom laid flat it looks like a fan rather than seams on all sides of a rectangle like tall kitchen bags this means the top flares out so it will fit the mouths of a variety of cans lastly the scent i have vanilla im not a big vanilla fan but i figured if they had done a terrible job scenting the bags that vanilla would be the least offensive smell but i actually really like the vanilla scent  as long as i can find these bags at a reasonable price i will continue to use them that scent and the act of taking out a small bag of unoffensive kitchen trash has been a game changer for metaking out the trash isnt nearly the chore it was before,very good,very good,very good,very good,very good

the quality is superior to most common brandsin love with 99 flavors keep up the good work,-,very good,-,-,very good
edit i am not sure why these came out of the package very shiny a dried leaf should not be shiny as for the packaging my reason for review its supposed to be easy open with a ziploc  when i rip off the top portion of the packaging i still have to use scissors to open it  also can they stop using plastic? theres also been reports that there are carcinogens in some of their flavored ones which is partly why i do not purchase those overall king palms are a great product but fix your packaging,-,good,-,good,good
great and slow burn,-,-,-,-,-
this is my 4th purchase and i will continue to repurchase as these size rolls are perfect for me i love them yes they are slow burning indeed  they are also a smooth clean smoke not harsh at all i keep them in the sealed bag that they come in they remain fresh while in there and never dry out packing product into them used to be time consuming however with practice ive become more efficient try it i dare you,-,very good,very good,-,very good
these are awesome for the most part pretty expensive compared to swishers every bag has at least 35 cones that dont work out either cracked or just dont function will continue to buy to avoid nicotine but its the end all,good,good,-,-,good

"i have the name brand disposable cleaners in all of our bathrooms but i found that i always had to put on a nitrile glove to finish cleaning the toilet once the cleaning scrubber fell off the round plastic holderevery time i also didnt want to use much pressure at the bottom of the toilet because i didnt want to go “fishing” for the sponge in the blue water gross

so after reading some reviews i decided to try this brand i love it

it works so much better than the name brand it doesnt have way too much cleanser like the name brand i always had trouble rinsing all the extra dark blue foam from under the rim of the toilet bowl but it has enough to do a thorough job the scrubbing pad stays attached thats a big one plus the storage kit is smaller than the name brand and doesnt take up as much room

i noticed other people comment on the lid not staying closed but i recently noticed that the brush handle has a little notch that holds the lid closed pretty clever

lastly although i chose not to use it they give you a double sided sticky pad that fits the entire bottom of the kit if you want to keep it from easily moving or getting knocked over this might be good if you have kids but i didnt use mine however i kept it in case i find another use for it

i definitely recommend this and ill be purchasing more for the rest of our bathrooms",-,very good,very good,-,very good
"it has the right amount of foam and does a good job of cleaning the bowl

the size of the package and the number of brush heads that come with it blow the competition out of the water its properly engineered so the extra brush heads dont slosh about in the plastic holder",-,good,-,good,good
they yellowed within days of coming out of the package  it looks like they are used even though they are not  they were not yellow in the package just when exposed to air  just an fyi they do not work with the clorox ones they are different sizes,-,good,-,good,good
so glad i gave this a try the scrubber works very well and stays on the wand just enough cleaning product in the pad brand has too much holding base smaller so less of a presence great purchase,-,very good,-,-,very good
i love how easy these are to use and the fact that i no longer have a dirty toilet brush sitting out in my bathroom,-,good,-,-,good
they are ok just smaller and less cleaning product than i expected,-,-,-,-,-
these are perfect for my bathroom wouldnt go back to having the old tb cleaner ever again too many germs i would definitely purchase again,-,-,-,-,-
"the lids can somewhat be tough to put on but overall a good buy and that just means theyre pretty secure lids
i made lots of jello shots in these and the size of the cups made the portions great also used them for condiments such as hot sauce mayo mustard

they withstood being thrown in an ice chest cooler with beers cans and lugged to the desert for a festival none broke open",-,very good,-,very good,very good
could be a little thicker but they do work and they are disposable i measured them at 3oz instead of 325oz for what thats worth for the price its hard to complain would buy again,poor,poor,-,-,poor
whether its packing ketchup for my daughters lunch or syrup for my sons pancakes these are great only feedback is that the lids while secure are not always leak proof since disposable,-,-,-,very good,very good
i use these to pack sauces and dips for my lunch they survive the day leak proof,-,poor,-,-,poor
i was tired of hit or miss finding these at my grocery store one bag is going to last me a while i use these for sauces in lunches snacks pills many many uses the lids fit perfect have not had a problem with a single one of them i would recommend these,-,very good,-,-,very good
some lids was stuck together and some cups had holes in them,-,-,-,-,-
i had to move snacks and cupcakes across town while keeping cool these cups were perfect to keep everything stable but cool easily transportable and easy to pick up and go will use forever,-,very good,-,-,very good
used for jelloshots  sturdy and packed well  no leaking  lids fit pretty snug  i should have just got the 1 ounce size for jelloshots though,-,very good,-,-,very good

"these dishwashing gloves feel a little thinner than the ones i previously had however thats not a problem because these gloves are durable and because they are a little thinner i can feel my dishes through them and grip things better so i actually prefer them over the other ones i used to use

you get three pair in a pack so they are affordbalem and the colors are bright and cheerful i keep one pair in my kitchen one in my bathroom and the third pair as a spare",-,very good,-,-,very good
these gloves are pretty long they cover the expanse of your arm i also have some questions about the durability of them as they seem pretty thin in material so much so that you can feel the heat from hot water pretty clearly  as if there is no protection at all on your hands i use these for washing dishes to get my hands not from pruning up and it suffices in that regard but i am not super pleased with them,-,poor,-,poor,poor
these gloves fit well on smaller hands the rubber is thinner than i am used to so i still feel the heat from super hot water but so far the gloves have been durable and work just as well while providing good grip or feel for what i am washing,-,very good,-,-,very good
it fits me good but it is thin i am not sure not how long it can last,-,neutral,-,-,neutral
these are very nice rubber gloves i like that i could pick different sizes and i picked a medium they fit me well and arent too big on me most gloves run quite large but these are nice as they are my size no type of lining inside but they do not leak or seep in liquid as youre cleaning or washing dishes some gloves really dry out my hands even though im not touching any product these did not and did a good job,-,very good,-,-,very good
these gloves feel a bit on the thinner size but they fit nicely and work for washing dishes,-,very good,-,-,very good
"if youre looking for the old skool zappers this is the one you want its a tiny little beast

so i have the big black flag unit  and its been doing its job wellish through three separate new light bulbs and or either 2 or 3 years either way i didnt expect it to live this long and wasnt sure it was doing its job so i got to looking at new units

so i bought this thing thinking i was buying a comparable unit to the big black flag the box arrived and i was sad at how cute this one was its so little

but then night came

this thing is awesome  this absolutely puts on a show and fries everything short of small aircraft this is the old skool zappers we all used to love its loud turns bugs into literal sparks and smoke and attracts everything including easily amused people

its been on since 8 and im writing this at 910 its literally crackling away like the 4th of july which my old big black flag never did there is a legit swarm of bugs flying around it unlike the black flag this thing blows them up and they look like little airplane crashes on their way down its already got a pile underneath it in less than an hour there are already several lizards and frogs gathered for the feast ive got it about knee high hanging off the ground for now but the swarm is too intense to try moving it higher so thats where it will stay tonight

seriously its powerful enough to be entertaining and puts out enough light to make it somewhat useful for low level lighting

and yes its supposed to smoke and smell like burning bugs thats literally how it works smells reminiscent of burning hair

that being said im ordering another one after i submit this",-,very good,-,very good,very good
ive had two different types of bug zappers before neither of which worked very well at all when i first hung this up on my porch and turned it on i thought it was malfunctioning because it started cracking and popping so much but sure enough when i looked at the screen i could see that it was because it was killing so many mosquitoes that had swarmed around when i came out the bulb uses 18 watts which at 10 per kilowatt hour means it will cost 130 per month so im definitely leaving it on 24 hours a day the kill screen uses a capacitor with a ~millisecond discharge so that cost isnt even enough to matter,bad,bad,bad,-,bad
i had three different zappers to compare and i must admit this one does it job way better than others it really attracts a lot of insects with its bright lamp however i am still returning it because zapping sound ended up being too loud for my balcony setup especially when it hits moth but the loudness applies to all 4000v zappers not just this one i d prefer lower voltage  fan however there is no good product that offers it,-,very good,-,-,very good
there are a lot of flies near my house at this time of the year i have tried a different bug zapper from home depot and it did not work well  the flies were not drawn to it  this one works way better  we use it near our patio and we were seeing the flies getting drawn to the zapper much faster than the previous one i got from home depot  the only thing that can be better is its not super easy to clear but thats common for outdoor zappers,-,neutral,neutral,-,neutral
summer is coming my daughter likes to play in the backyard but children are particularly the target of mosquitoes my neighbor recommended me to buy this and i put it in the backyard it has no noise  small and it is to hang up the 4200v electricity is strong enough to kill the fly and mosquitoes for our small backyard,-,poor,-,-,poor
"it zaps em dead alright doesnt get hot however there are a couple improvements necessary first the cord is rather short plugging it in on the deck where the outlet isnt convenient is a hassle plus bending down to find it  this brings me to another issue connected to this no on/off switch i dont remember having an electric appliance without a switch

anyway im keeping it and ill update review if necessary after i use it for a while its late spring lots of bugs but a lot more coming",-,poor,-,-,poor
for me mosquitoes are the most annoying problem that i can not deal with there are always some mosquitoes in my room or my backyard this zapper will easily catch these mosquitoes easy to clean make sure to put it in a darker place the effects will much better,-,-,-,-,-
the media could not be loaded,-,-,-,-,-
this bug zapper 360 suspension anti mosquito is great we live in louisiana where the gnats and skeeters are plentiful jeeze they suck i bought 3 of these because summer is approaching and we get carried away with the skeeters around here and the gnats are worse than theyve ever been i got the bug zappers in and put 2 outside one under the patio table and one behind where we sit at the patio table these things work we can finally sit outside and watch the kids in their kiddie pool without having a face full of gnats and our legs eaten alive by the skeeters i got one extra to put out next to my chicken coop in the backyard because the gnats are in the coop pestering my girls it got moths gnats flies corn bugs love bugs and a bunch other bugs it was so full after a couple hours last night that when i opened the bottom to dump it out some was dropping on the ground very happy customer and it says you can add attractant in the bottom for the bugs but we didnt put any in there and it worked awesomely as soon as we turned it on it started zapping,-,good,-,-,good

it wont stain your white thing blue fresh and doesnt make me itch like most detergents do,-,-,-,-,-
ive been contending with itchy red swelling rashes off and on for over 60 years ya never know whats causing which particular rash where detergents colors and perfumes are about the most difficult to figure out once youve determined the cause of your neverending tortuous existence you happily wash your clothing wash your sheets wash your towels wash your coats wash everything you touch childrens items youre possibly free of this irritant tide  pods free  gentle has saved your day/life  until someone lends you a shirt socks jacket  but now we have the answer  finally tide without perfumes without color without some irritating detergent its free and so are many of us  if you have allergic reactions skin sensitivities or just itch give this detergent a try its worth trying,-,very good,-,-,very good
tide is the best and the unscented pod is even better  will order again,-,-,-,-,-
love these but i like to see suds in my wash have to use 3 at a time depending on the size of the laundry load and the garments liquid ends up less expensive in the end but not a lot of mess sometimes fyi if you have a laundry closet leave the door open with these in the room especially when washing and drying it gets too hot in the enclosed closet and these explode,very good,very good,very good,-,very good

got these as the perfect cleanup tools near our kitty litter boxes very handy for scattered litter but noticed on the first use that i was also sweeping up bristles from the broom itself has only happened on occasion since then so hoping these hold up for longterm use,-,very good,-,very good,very good
love thesetheyre handy for a lot of things  i actually dust off my swiffer  wipes and reuse them  right now i am  removing carpet and installing linoleum these fit perfectly between the baseboard and the floor to get out all the trash located there  even a vacuum cleaner cant fit in there to get all the trash  dust any small crevice easily and effectively,-,very good,-,-,very good
these brush and dustpan combinations are good enough  they do what theyre supposed to do  they arent as sturdy as some of the name brand competitors but are less expensive  for light duty theyre fine,good,good,-,-,good
i was surprised by how sturdy these little hand brooms turned out to be in my area this shape of hand broom is also weirdly hard to find perfect for around the cat box,-,-,-,very good,very good
"each of these sets the dustpan and brush are small fortunately that makes them easy to deploy and whip up on a small sweep job the fact that these sets the dustpan and brush are small does not mean the sets are useless or anything close to useless they are very handy to have around ive stashed sets in the bathrooms and bedrooms they handle small jobs right there on the spot  no running off to the kitchen to figure out what you need to do to clean up that small mess the brush is very useful it fits into places it can brush out small compacted areas
i suspect that during a party one could give ones rugrat a set and command the little darling to scurry about with these unobtrusive dustpan sets to sweep up the bits that your slobby guests keep dropping fortunately these dustpan sets  while small  are made of what seems to be a durable plastic so theyll very likely endure",-,good,-,-,good
i should have read reviews before buying  i thought these were average size  nope,-,-,-,-,-
great for sweeping my truck going to these rail yards and customers you track all kinds of dust dirt and mud and you dont want to ride around with a big ole broom so this is perfect for storage,-,-,-,-,-
i bought this to spot clean my guinea pigs poops but it cleaned their hair and hay remnants too i was expecting to have it do the bulk missing a bunch of pellets id have to pick up by hand but it got everything i wasnt planning on using it outside the cage either but it worked even better on the carpet im extremely impressed,-,very good,-,-,very good
use these daily definitely recommend using the sleeves they can get soft but not soggy if liquid is left in it too long however one cup can withstand multiple uses of both hot and cold which means a pack can last you longer than expected lids fit very well and have not experienced any breaks or leaks,-,very good,-,-,very good
very happy with these travel cups i work from home and pretty much spend the day drinking coffee these cups last and dont leak the seam stays sealed and doesnt start to get soft like other paper cups i have purchased in the past the cup wrap is also nice to have to keep cup cooler to hold will buy again definitely,-,very good,-,-,very good

so i just received both the detergent and fabric softener in the beach sage scent today the detergent has a nice light and smooth beachy and herbal scent now lets talk about the fabric softener nowhere close to the detergent scent i took a whiff and was knocked out by how strong it is it smells like straight up vapor rub on steroids i never sniffed this scents fabric softener so i had no idea what to expect i dont know if its supposed to smell like this or if i got a bad one but boy if youre sick with congestion one sniff and not only will it clear up congestion in no time but i believe youll be cold and flu free for the next couple of years sheesh the good thing is that you arent going to smell it once your clothes are dried ill check again after an hour or two because thats when ill really smell the actual scent on my clothes but i hope it smells like the detergent so far i dont smell anything at all maybe next time ill try to buy it somewhere else to see if i got a bad one or not,-,bad,bad,-,bad

ok hand i dont like soft toilet paper because  it gets used up so quickly also was told to have toilet paper more likely to clog the toilet so this paper is great in that regard

the only downside to this silverware is that its so nice that i felt guilty throwing it awaywhich is the whole point of disposable silverware  if you want an elegant look for your partythis is it  i love how it came with a disproportionately larger number of forks  yes you might grab another fork for dessert so it makes perfect sense  highly recommended,-,very good,-,-,very good

perfect for my rose gold themed party the table looked beautiful  loved that the set came with so many forks you always need more forks,-,very good,-,-,very good
"i recently purchased a set of gold plastic forks for a party and i must say i was thoroughly impressed with their quality and performance these forks are solid durable and heavyduty making them the perfect utensils for any occasion

the gold plastic forks are made from highquality materials that are sturdy and reliable they feel solid in the hand and have a substantial weight to them which makes them ideal for use with any type of food the tines are also strong and welldesigned allowing them to easily pierce and hold food without bending or breaking

one of the standout features of these forks is their versatility they are suitable for use in any setting from casual backyard barbecues to formal dinner parties their elegant and classy appearance makes them ideal for upscale events while their durability and sturdiness make them equally suitable for more casual settings they also come in a convenient pack size making them ideal for larger gatherings

another significant advantage of these gold plastic forks is their easy cleanup unlike traditional silverware they are disposable which eliminates the need for washing and cleaning after use this makes them a great option for those who want to save time and effort during cleanup

overall i highly recommend these gold plastic forks they are the perfect utensils for any occasion and their solid and durable construction ensures that they will hold up well to regular use additionally their elegant appearance and convenient disposable nature make them a great choice for both formal and casual events if you are looking for a reliable and versatile set of plastic forks these are definitely worth considering",-,very good,very good,very good,very good

"for those that want the squeaky clean feel this mop set up is for you ive used swifter in the past but i would have to change the padding 23 times to get all the dirt out with this 2 system no wringing no pouring in new fresh water

you do have wash the microfiber mop head frequently esp in a big house  or else starts to smell
yes you still have to dump the dirty water when all done but its satisfying
my main critic is that the length of the mop is way to short im avg height us 56 it s needs another 612in in to feel comfortable
second i saw  it cheaper at home depot  go figure so please compare   but way to easy to order with prime

i highly recommend this product",very good,very good,very good,-,very good

its the best mop that i had so far i am glad i went with the newer version  i really like how the dirty water is separated keeping my floors cleaner  i think adding wheels on the bottom would make mopping easier but it still slides around well enough without the wheels i really recommend this mop to anyone who is looking to buy a new mop,-,-,-,-,-
"will this make mopping fun? no
will it make it easier? yes a little because of how the mop is rinsed and wrung out and how easy it is to refill the bucket
will it get your floors cleaner than a regular mop yes a little because of how it separates the clean and dirty water
it works great for how its intended  regular light cleaning of floors everything is plastic so it wont hold up to abuse as long as you are using it as intended it will be fine if you are trying to stomp on the pedal as hard has you can to see how fast it will spin you will probably break it and that will be your fault

the advertisement states 33 gallon trash bags  150 count my disappointment is that once i received the item the bags were to small for my 33 gallon trash can  which made me reread the listing which also states in the description that it has a 30 gallon capacity it would be too much trouble to go through the return process since i discarded the package it came in the shipping was quick and i cant speak on the quality because i have yet to use it,-,bad,bad,bad,bad

wont collapse from the edge when you throw something heavy in the can

anyway please cover your parents cover dog food and bird seed super annoying mistake",-,very good,very good,very good,very good

"when our hoa stopped spraying for mosquitoes as a result of some very loud and selfrighteous complaints from two households who were completely convinced without any supporting evidence that a coordinated spraying of permethrin by the county during the evening hours while children usually arent playing outside and under the oversight of an entomologist represented a greater health hazard than the mosquitoes themselves i wanted to find an alternative solution those households may be right  i dont pretend to have any scientific data  im simply observing that the complainants dont either and im a little suspicious of their grasp of statistics given that the narrative they seem to have projected was one of disapproval by a majority of the neighborhood when as i said i counted two complaining households but its not as though i like the idea of spraying chemicals this electrical zapper sounded like a pretty clean solution that couldnt possibly hurt humans through some poorly understood biochemical boogeyman so i was looking forward to trying it there are so many positive reviews of this product that i had no idea bug zappers are as controversial a product as they are

you see it may well have killed mosquitoes but it also killed a lot of moths — and i have no quarrel with the moths its not clear to me what proportion of the bugs killed are actually biting/stinging insects which are the ones that i care about further complicating matters there are many different species of mosquitoes and its not clear how strongly attracted all of them or any of them really are to this light it seems to be a fairly indiscriminate insect slaughter at best and at worst it might actually be doing a better job of attracting and killing nonbiting/stinging insects than killing the bugs i actually want gone some people have even expressed the opinion that they actually increase the local bug activity because the light attracts them but doesnt do a great job of killing them i dont have any scientific data to offer and again there are many different species of mosquitoes so what works for you may not work for someone else it certainly didnt seem to make our mosquito situation any worse when we tried it for a week but thats just my subjective impression from sitting outside

and beyond the questionable impact on your local insect population some of whom play critical environmental roles that i dont pretend to understand its actually a lot more disruptive to the quiet enjoyment of my property than id expected i positioned it about 50 feet away from my back porch so as not to attract bugs to where id be sitting and i found the bright light and zapping sounds to be fairly disruptive — to the point that i even started to worry it might bother the neighbors too and were on 1 acre lots so were not exactly sitting right on top of each other and uv light supposedly isnt good for the eyes it also needed to be brushed fairly often maybe in time the volume of bugs would go down as it decimates the local population but i was cleaning it daily during my short experiment with the device

if youre sure you want a bug zapper then this particular model seems like a fine one to buy i saw no particular defects in quality my experience has simply turned me off to the whole idea of a bug zapper ive started using something called a skeetotrap and am tentatively pleased with it its a fairly low maintenance solution  just add some water now and then  and you dont need to figure a way to get electricity to the location where you want to set it up its also comparatively inexpensive there are various proposals on the internet for building your own mosquito trap from a soda bottle but rumor has it those dont really work and i find it more than a little irritating how readily these proposals get repeated across the internet by people who seem not to have made even the most basic effort to try to determine whether it actually works i only claim to be tentatively pleased with the skeetotrap at this juncture having tried it for a few weeks and will update this review when i feel like i can make a more authoritative conclusion but i am finding what appear to be dead mosquitoes inside of it",bad,bad,bad,bad,bad

i live out in the country on top of a barn that holds horses and feed so theres a lot of bugs to bother me while im sitting on the porch or every time i open my front door ever since i plugged this in there has been a difference theres no longer bugs attacking my phone at night haha and i can open my front door without worrying about having a bunch of moths living rent free in on my ceiling the slots are kinda thin so the fat bugs cant get into it which is a bit annoying but its whatever overall i would buy this product again and recommend it to someone else,-,good,good,-,good

it worked very well but when i tried to find refills i cant find them  it seems wasteful  ill buy some that have refills available next time,-,poor,poor,-,poor
i have to admit i didnt think these would work  those tiny black gnats or fruit flies or whatever you want to call them drive me crazy  i love propagating new plants so i have many pots of moist soil all year round in my house  however moist soil attracts those tiny pests  they even hang around the drains in my kitchen and bathroom sinks and especially this past spring and summer with all the rain we had theres no way i can use chemical pesticides in or around my home because i have 8 small birds and 2 toy poodles  these are the next best option for me  the bottom has an inverted triangular shape which helps jam it into the soil securely then peel off the white paper to expose the stickiness  its made of thin plastic and bends to fit the curve of any size pot if you choose to insert it at the edge like i did  they are also doublesided and you can peel off both sides to catch the pests faster  i chose to peel off one side at a time because they are very sticky and i found neighboring plant leaves stuck to it because i put the other plant too close  after the first side was full i flipped it around and peeled off the existing paper on the opposite side to reveal a fresher sticky surface  looking at the picture you can see the used side was still sticky enough for me to place the paper back onto it to protect the neighboring plants  however i think you could use any shape or type of paper if youve already tossed the original piece or the new one you just took off  there were several patterns in the pack i received and they look cute tucked into a pot  even though the gnats are attracted to it they lose their appeal to humans as they fill up with the pests  i have several around the house and i believe there is also some kind of ingredient in the stickiness although there is no detectable smell to humans to attract the gnats because only those tiny black gnats are stuck to it  i havent seen any other type of pest on them  i have had them for over a month and they are still attracting the pests  if you have lots of house plants that require constant moist soil and/or moist climate and you dont want to or cannot spray pesticides then these cute traps are a great alternative  the particular package i bought also came with twisties to hang them just cut off the triangle on the bottom so it looks better or use your own string or thread  they also came with sticks that you can attach the triangle to should you prefer the trap to be much higher than the soil  as far as pricing goes these are quite inexpensive for the quality and you can choose from many different patterns  i am very satisfied with this product and i intend to buy again when i need more  however that might be a while as i bought a 24pack and they seem to last a very long time  a for value  a for effectiveness,very good,very good,very good,very good,very good

these are very sticky  its kinda gross to me to see all these dead gnats stuck to them but its doing what i needed it to do  be careful not to let them touch the leaves of your plants because they dont come off easily  i used a plastic bag to grab it and just flipped the bag over it to discard when it was no longer needed,-,bad,-,-,bad

"we have moved out to our trailer campsite and mosquito season is in full swing there its difficult to enter the trailer without bringing in a halfdozen mosquitos these are especially annoying in the bedroom at night
so i set up this bug light in the room and we turn it on a few hours before bedtime it definitely attracts mosquitoes and the extremely loud snap tells me that it is very powerful  its a louder snap than any other bug light ive seen in fact
i was dubious at first as to how well it would work with mosquitoes some models ive used have had very large mesh and as a result mosquitoes often slipped through while moths were completely fried this definitely kills mosquitos they are wellcharred when they hit the collection bin below
the unit is very lightweight you can hang this on a garden planter pole with ease or even fashion a coathanger hook to hang it from eavestroughing without worrying about damaging the troughing it has a ring on top to attach to a hook or cord
it is listed as weatherproof but if youre having a serious rainstorm i would unplug it and bring it inside by nature it has to be open to allow mosquitoes to enter and i would not want to have it running if exposed to heavy rain of course
cleaning is very easy  a tray at the bottom slides out and you can dump the little charred bugs in the trash or in the woods
overall i would rate this one 10/10 for quality and value",very good,very good,very good,-,very good
"the product work as expected you can use it at night because the bugs will be attracted by the light and throughout the day the light is not attracting the bugs  at night you it works great  it makes quite a noticeable noise when the bugs get shocked but nothing too extreme that you can get used to
i really like the fact that it will work for fruit flies i have many indoor plants and consume fruits due to which i see lot of fruit flies this bug zapper worked like a magic easy to operate safe and easy to clean
i bought this item in april even though the mosquitos werent out yet i set it up anyway to my surprise the few early bugs that were out were attracted to the light and eliminated so far i am very impressed i can hardly wait to spend some mosquito free days in my backyard this summer  warm whether comes back with mosquito wed like to enjoy the dinner outside this blue light attaches the mosquito and gives us a enjoyable environment that s safer than any other chemical spray",-,very good,-,-,very good
"got this a few days ago it works very well so far and keep us away from bugs it is sturdy as well and it looks safer than the other similar products i saw on amazon i live in a region with quite a lot of flying insects so i used it both indoors and outdoors on the balcony and it zaps a few bugs every time i left it on so it definitely does what it supposes to do
zap zap zap i love hearing those little mosquitos vaporise  it sounds like the crack of a little whip there is a very faint hum the rest of the time but nothing too obvious it definitely works brilliantly on mosquitos inside a dark room i havent yet tested it with other lights on or against house flies
the blue light would be handy as a strong night light when chatting with friends into the evening and it hardly uses any power at all except for a fraction of a second during a zap
the bug zapper is much bigger than i expected the same as another reviewer said but it still took me by surprise it does seem sturdy it gives the impression of being well made and sealed",-,very good,very good,-,very good
"love this bug zapper i was in doubt on first day of use but by a few hours it already started zapping most effective in dark surrounding i left my kitchen window open all night because its hot in summer as my husband said the news has spreadits like millions of insects coming for a suicide gosh now that i know i close all windows when i have this on
this is superb ive gone through a lot of various bug zappers  urgh now he is brown bread thanks to the efficiency of this unit
you can gauge the size of the unit its big but very lightweight and has no sharp edges or metal points that could catch you accidentally
it was hard finding an item like this that wasnt an eye sore this one is quite stylish and goes well with our vibe at the house surprisingly this zapper does not buzz annoyingly or make any noise really you wouldnt know it was there it has let us enjoy our nights on the patio without worrying about flying pests the cord could be a bit longer but an extension cord does the trick overall it was a great purchase of a high quality item",-,very good,-,-,very good

"this bug zapper really made a big difference you can keep the unit on stool patio table or hang with the hook provided no more mosquitos or bugs and can stay late night outdoors comfortably family and kids usually stay within 40 feet x 40 feet area where our barbeque and patio tables set up and have not experienced any mosquitos within this boundary may cover wider area as stated by seller cleaning the tray with dish soap frequently depending on the use keeps the unit nice and clean though it says the design is waterproof i move the unit under the shed after use to be safer  overall impressed with the quality design  functionality and strongly recommend this unit to get rid of mosquitos or bugs
like the following features
1nice decorative design easy to use just plug the power cord and start using right out of the box
2the uv light is comfortable and does not give any strain on the eyes even in the dark night
3pull out tray and cleaning rod for easy cleaning the collected bugs

"the lefree 2 pack silicone toilet brush offers a practical and hygienic solution for keeping my toilet clean the silicone bristles are gentle yet effective in removing stains and grime leaving the toilet bowl looking fresh and sanitized the compact design of the brush and holder makes it easy to store and keeps the bathroom neat and organized

however one minor drawback is that compared to other brushes ive used i have to apply slightly more pressure and scrub a bit harder to achieve the same level of cleanliness while this is not a major issue it does require a bit more effort during the cleaning process

on the positive side the silicone material is durable and resistant to wear ensuring longlasting use the brush is also easy to clean and doesnt retain any unpleasant odors which is a significant advantage compared to traditional bristle brushes",-,very good,-,very good,very good
when i brought the box in off my porch i thought this cant be toilet bowl brushes as the box was so small  but they come disassembled but so easy to assemble  it just took me a minute  nice directions on the box just screw the pieces together  i didnt realize the holder attaches to the wall in the bathroom  i wasnt sure about how that would look but im sold  i love it not taking up floor space in my small bathrooms  it looks just right  i plan to buy more for my other bathrooms  an excellent purchase  allow more time for delivery however,-,very good,very good,very good,very good
"i wasnt sure which of the three id like best i was intrigued by the flat triangle shape of the sellemer i liked the round compact look of the lefree and the boomjoy had a nice tweezer attachment which i can use to clean out hairs in my shower drain also boomjoy was the cheapest of all three

so you can see in my photo the type of packaging they come in the sellemer and lefree both also come with a little plastic piece that you can stick to your wall and hang the brush on your wall not really sure i care to do that though

i also placed all the brushes next to a coffee mug so you can see approximately what the sizes are i like the sellemer in that its svelte the lefree is also quite compact the boomjoy has the largest base so it would seem to take up most space but the size differences as you can see are minimal

the brushes in the lefree and sellemer hang to drain that is when you put the brush into the holder its suspended and theres a ventilated bottom the boomjoy is a solid bottom piece and the brush rests in it like a bowl i suppose that can cause some water accumulation and wont dry as easily/quickly

all three required the handles to be twisted on which were easy enough on all three i liked the handles on the sellemer and lefree over the boomjoy the boomjoy was the only one that had a metal part to the handle but for some reason it felt a bit flimsy the other two had all plastic handles

this is the first time i tried silicone brushes and overall i like the way the clean/work over the old bristle ones

sellemer i thought i would like the triangular shape as it said it could get under the lip easily but in trying all three of them out the flat triangular shape actually made it feel a little flimsier so i didnt feel i could brush as hard against the toilet i did like that there seemed to be good density on this one with the silicone bristles

lefree this one looked like it was most lacking in silicone bristles they were all spaced somewhat far apart but it still seemed to clean fine and i could press it up against the lip of the toilet and it got under there just fine just as fine as the sellemer i felt i could press pretty hard against the surface of the toilet too to scrub some of those harder water stains out

boomjoy this seemed to have more dense silicone bristles than the lefree but less than the sellemer it also worked much like the lefree i could get under the toilet lip easily and scrub pretty hard against the toilet surface

honestly they are all made in china products so the quality is all pretty much the same so what you are really deciding on are small features and which style you like the best

personally knowing what i know now i would buy the lefree while the bristles were the least dense it seemed to clean just as well as the others it has a small footprint with a ventilated bottom i just didnt really care for the flimsy feel of the flat triangle sellemer and the boomjoys nonventilated bottom bothered me a bit in that i think if water were to gather and drip when i pick it up next time it would be gross i do like having the tweezer but is it really necessary? it also has the largest base i do like its very sleek look though and the fact that it doesnt put its brand across the base

also if price is of concern the sellemer was most expensive at around 1517 depending on when you buy it i see a lot of price fluctuations the lefree is around 13 and the boomjoy was 999

overall all three worked pretty well and i think i will stick to silicone over the bristles from now on",very good,very good,very good,very good,very good

knowing that i bought it anyway along with the board cream i reasoned that as much as i spent on my boos block and in consideration of reported issues with splitting and/or warping i might as well try it as insurance if nothing else to show that i explicitly followed maintenance instructions in case something does go awry fwiw a little goes a long way and this bottle looks like itll last a long time after that ill likely switch to generic food grade oil but i think its worth it once at least",good,good,good,good,good

"i keep these in my purse i keep them in my car i keep them below the sink in every bathroom in the house i gave a box to my best friend when she went camping i take them on every trip these are worth every penny ive reordered them multiple times

when you need a wipe you really need a wipe why is it you always have an issue just before something important happens like a job interview or before you get on the plane or youre 2000 miles from home on a long road trip and in the dirtiest grubbiest gas station youve ever seen without a speck of toilet paper in sight? why do our bodies not behave when we need them to the most?

these wipes are miraculous theyre worth their weight in gold at that moment ive never had any issues after using these  no irritation sensitivity dryness or something worse

one of the things i like about the individually wrapped ones is that theyre easily concealed even if you dont have pockets and arent carrying a bag  you can crumple it in your hand or slip a wipe up your sleeve you dont have to carry a big pack of wipes that scream im having issues down there

"like i said its exactly what you think and if youve used this before you get that and if not then suffice it to say they do what you think  obviously its best not to flush and im not gonna go into that aspect  my issue is with the packaging and why the bait and switch is necessary  i mean i have a refill hard case so i order the bulk package just like you see in the product ad  if id wanted 168 of these in 8 plastic packages of 42 that i had to fight with to open and then put in my refill container id have probably shipped for them that way  also to be sure these 8 take at least twice the cabinet space as the bulk product i ordered so that kinda sucks in my tiny bathroom with its tiny cabinet

should have been a simple 5 star review of a product im familiar with but how can you give this 5 stars when i have to take a photo and write all this?  just the exact reason we love the convince of online shopping but are so often disappointed and end up wasting time  one last thought here i had a small single piece of plastic bag turn into a whole pile of plastic  not happy with that at all

also it may have been an error but it shows when you buy 168 pack of 2  isnt that 336 total? and 8 individually wrapped packs of 42 is definitely only 168 so go figure",-,poor,poor,poor,poor

when you want the final wipe where the sun dont shine then these are the wipes that work best they are thicker than most and dont fall apart in use i am a bit skeptical about flushable but if they say so ok i was happy to see this huge pack because since the shortages of this spring the paper products are always out in our store now with this huge multipack i have enough wipes to last me through the next millenium well maybe not but there are a lot of them at a very good price,very good,very good,-,-,very good
you can find a higher quality wrap for a much more expensive price but this will work fine if you know what youre doing and you only need it for home use the next level up in price appears to be about twice as much as this i would recommend a thicker film for a restaurant or other professional use i am personally using this film to replace the plastic wrap rolls in my existing 12 inch zip cutter dispenser thats where this product shines if you have a good dispenser refill it with these,very good,very good,-,-,very good

"the wrap adheres well and is bpafree which gives me peace of mind i find it to be of similar quality to the plastic wrap i typically purchase at costco one thing to be cautious of is the blade component which can be a bit sharp but is helpful for cutting the wrap

plastic wrap can be a pain to use weve all cut ourselves on the dispensers serrated blades accidentally broken the boxes or watched helplessly as the plastic wrap stuck to itself preventing us from getting a neat easytouse square of film for me the key characteristic of plastic wrap is its cling this plastic wrap clung well to all the materials i used it on i was able to successfully use one sheet to seal and reseal bowls the wrap is durable resisting tears and deformation i also placed chicken cutlets in the plastic wrap placed them flat in freezer bags and froze them after close to a week when i was ready to use them i noticed that they remained tightly wrapped and ice crystalfree overall a great product at a great price,good,good,-,good,good

these bags are small they fit in a regular bathroom wastebasket and thats size wastebasket i use in my kitchen and bathrooms and office and everywhere else i like small baskets because i dont like having the garbage inside my house a 30gallon garbage can blows my mind shudder so i empty garbage from all the rooms into the fullest wastebasket hope that makes sense every day and then the full basket goes out to the garage the only drawback is that im using more plastic than i would like but i justify this by heavily composting and digesting food and scraps and recycling i live in a town where we have to pay for our trash bags  it takes me approximately two months to fill one of those bags completely the only way i would be able to do it is if i could get the trash out of my house the bags are clear and unscented which means less chemical processing than the fancy stuff,-,very good,-,-,very good

due to the pricing i decided to try this off brand out  i havent used all six of them yet however the one that i have used worked great  i think they are bigger and absorb better than the name brand one that comes with the mop  fits perfectly into the mop handle and removes easily for cleaning as well  i threw them in the washing machine for easy cleaning  i have only used this one once so if im opinion changes i will update but upon first use i really like these,-,very good,-,-,very good
easy to clean and wont break the bank if you have to throw them away,-,-,-,-,-
i bought these to save money on the name brand to be honest i feel like they work better than the ocedar its full and absorbent seems to hold the water better so im not dipping it in the bucket as often but still gets enough of the water off to not to be too wet i had no trouble with it fitting on the handle either would purchase again,neutral,neutral,-,-,neutral

the box was damaged the one pack of the plates some o them were bent up,-,-,-,poor,poor
discovered the plates were so stuck together that we had to pull apart before putting in buffet line they looked awful since we had to stack them off balance so people could get them  someone tried to put them back in line and we had to explain the situation to them  several people took multiple plates before we realized the problem,-,-,-,bad,bad
if you are looking for hard clear plastic plates somewhat elegant these are not for you i needed them in a hurry for a funeral reception and didnt really study the description these are soft flexible plastic kind of milky looking  the only way they would work for a stand up reception or to carry food across a room is to use at least two together which is of course pretty hard to manage in a buffet they are as flexible as paper they seem as if hot fiid would melt them  peeling them apart was also difficult i went through the whole stack putting a piece of paper between each two plates so each person would automatically take two plates my occasion was the next day and i thought i had to make them work fortunately i was able to find appropriate plates in a local store at the last minute so im saving these plates for an informal picnic they will be fine for an occasion at which i would otherwise use paper plates,-,very good,-,-,very good
they are alright but not clear  they have a slight frosty yellow to them  not thrilled but not bad enough to send back either,-,-,-,-,-
i appreciate the value of this product and the fact the plates are clear however they are extremely hard to separate from each other when trying to remove one from the stack  ive nearly broken my fingernails multiple times and did manage to give myself a minor cut on the edge of my finger while separating a plate  i will use until theyre gone but i will not buy them again,neutral,neutral,neutral,-,neutral

i really like the huge rolls if you dont mind a large dispenser these big rolls are nice as they simply last 2 people a very long time usually 1 roll per month is what we average

if you dont have a dispenser i have just had a roll sitting out on a counter next to toilet i have even place it over a heavy based vertical paper towel holder and had it work fine the dispensers can be wall hung or just laid on side on a counter next to toilet which is how we do it

"biggest negative  a bit flimsy to grip even my weaker hand grip found these a bit flimsy to grip takes getting used to if you use a firm grip instead i use a 2nd cup like a sleeve much better grip  feel its a waste of one cup out of a package but worth it to me it actually adds insulation so i suppose thats a plus

one other thing i dont care for  16oz cup is a bit narrow at the bottom for my likes im always afraid itll get knocked over easily

those two negatives aside im quite satisfied ive tried a lot of others and can honestly say this dixie cup is my favorite and my go to disposable never had a leak can warm it up in the microwave and the 2nd cup i use as a sleeve adds sturdiness

note i said warm it up in the microwave if necessary i do about 2030 seconds at a time until the liquid reaches the temperature i want i never go from cold to hot at one interval actually with these cups ive never mwd one that wasnt at least warm to start with

i usually get the size down for this product  i have a review there too i wanted to try and get more caffeine into my system in the mornings the cups are structurally fine they fit a good amount of liquid they only spill when i overfill them overall wonderful the problem i have is that the size of them means you have to finish your drink twice as fast or it is cold instead of hot i am a slow drinker if you drink like a normal person these are fine i probably just need to switch to a stainless steel thermos but i cant currently wash something every day so its not possible if my situation sounds like yours dont use these if you dont have these issues then the cups are great slow drinkers are just going to have a time with the quicker cooling,-,very good,very good,-,very good

i use them for a lot of different things from arts and crafts to paints that i mix to holding glitter slime beads clips nails glue and more my family also likes to use them for condiments or small snacks when we just want a little bit of something they are very useful and the fact that they have lids too is great i can pack my daughter snacks to go like carrots and ranch or celery and peanut butter and know that things wont spill or get too messy while in her lunchbox these have come in handy for many different reasons i a going to buy some more soon but i think ill get bigger ones this time its nice to have a little extra room for things and itll make it useful for more then i use them for now good product easy to clean or just throw away when done holds more then youd imagine and last for a while lids are secure and stay on however the plastic is a little on the thin side when it comes to durability and i wish it was a little stronger when it comes to getting squished by heavier objects or squeezed,-,very good,very good,very good,very good
i was very impressed when i discovered swedish dish cloths they dont hold odors and bacteria like sponges do yet they are absorbent and are very easy to clean i usually just put some dishwashing detergent on them squeeze them around rinse them and put them aside to dry for next time but i can also put them on the top shelf of my dishwasher i bought this 12 pack and gave 3 to each of my sisters these cloths last so long that it has been months and i am still rotating the first two that i took out of the package for my own use i use them to scrub dishes pots and pans my stove and countertops i pick up spills quickly i will never go back to sponges,-,very good,very good,very good,very good

i bought these because i tried a more expensive swedish dish towel and liked it this set seems to clean well but takes more effort to squeeze it out for drying my husband has arthritis in his hands and can never squeeze it out well enough when you dont squeeze all the water out it gets smelly when it dries out they do wash well in the washing machine though,very good,-,-,-,very good
"ive heard a lot about the swedish dish cloths as a way to reduce use of paper towels and thought id give them a shot i bought these and a set that was more inexpensive and not yet rated there were a couple differences but not enough to make me get these again

1 smushy out of the package these are definitely more more pliable than the other pack which came out of the package like cardboard kind of like a cellulose sponge fresh out of the pack with that kind of feel and smell
2 sturdy i have used them to clean up kitchen messes and to wash dishes the ones ive used from the pack so far have held up well and are still going
3 washable i really like that after a few uses i can toss them into the laundry wash them with other towels and hang out to dry i dont think they would like being tossed in the dryer once dry back into use
4 more expensive at the time i purchased these were 092 each pack of 12 and the others were  us070 each pack of 10

there are still uses for which i use paper towels and not these like draining bacon but for general cleanup these are just fine i will probably stick with the cheaper ones i got because they seem to perform as well as these",very good,very good,very good,very good,very good

"amazon would not post my 1st review because they said i reviewed the seller i didnt make any mention of the seller the only mention i made was the advertisement on the web page says that theres an even smooth separation when you tear them apart which is completely not my experience and so this is my review posted a second time
the product used to be fabulous there used to be no issues separating the sheets beyond the normal once in awhile situation however my last two orders which are all made by the same manufacturer i literally had to fight with the thing and it drove me crazy because i try to separate a used sheet and the perforation was anything but clean and id end up pulling two of them out and then i try to separate another and then id end up wasting 4 sheets because they get all stuck together
if the manufacturer could fix this 1 issue i would be pleased as i was happy with the stickiness to pick up pet hair quickly",-,very good,very good,-,very good

original reviewi bought them for replacements for my ocedar brand mop they were noticeably smaller than the mop heads that came with my original ocedar mop by about 2 inches so they do not fit on my original plastic mop head and the threads for the mop head that they came with dont match up to my ocedar mop handles threads i bought a new handle to try and combat this those threads didnt match that one either upsidedown face they seem like quality mop heads but im going to have to macgyver them to my mop handles for them to work",-,very good,-,-,very good

weve all been there youre going about your own business when you notice its eerily quiet not like a peaceful quiet but a “someone is doing something they shouldnt be” quiet you frantically begin searching the house room by room you go opening doors and hoping whatever is on the other side isnt beyond repair and then you hear ityour heart starts racing as you run in the direction of the noise you swing the bathroom door wide open and to your sheer horror there stands your toddler and every single lego he owns swirling to the dark depths of the universe as he flushes them down the toilet you quickly thrust your hand into the bottom of the bowl blindly grabbing anything you can get ahold of and then the waters begin to rise you know if you dont act quickly that your bathroom floor will look like a tsunami hit legocity leaving no survivors behind you quickly grab the plunger and you pray to god no skyscrapers helicopters or gorillas made it down the hole as you plunge your little heart out but its too late the waters pour out over the edges of the bowl like tears that just wont stop as you stand there in socks soaked in toilet water and your toddler who is smiling from ear to ear stands there looking at you like a damn hero and you are mama you are a hero alas you dont have to be a barehanded toilet diver to be one anymore thanks to this aesthetically pleasing toilet bowl brush and plunger set you can now use tweezers to retrieve all the crap literally and figuratively that your toddler tries to flush down the toilet with a rubber brush its one less thing you have to worry about staining or stinking when youre done simply place it in its holder next to its side kick the plunger who holds the key to the cityaka the tweezers this dynamic trio will not disappoint and just in case it does theres an added bonus brush to get in those hard to reach crevices moms dont go into battle unprepared anymore equip yourselves with the tools to fight dirty while staying clean,-,very good,-,very good,very good

the super handy plunger which has unclogged my toilet with minimal effort the suction is outstanding i rent a townhouse so its very important that the water doesnt flood my bathroom floor and cause massive damage
this set also has a low profile and will fit perfectly under any size sink or in the corner
one thing i greatly appreciate is the bristle are silicone so they can be easily wiped off and disinfected no gross bits left i dont regret this purchase at all it has saved me on having to drop loads of cash for a plumber
i feel like this product really shines in spaces where there isnt much real estate but of course it would be an invaluable tool in any size bathroom make sure you arent caught with your pants down without this plunger",-,very good,very good,-,very good
such a great space saver same price as the ones in store except it comes with so much more i love the convenience of the 2 in 1 plunger for both sink and toilet clogs i love the builtin tweezers in the handle of the toilet brush for drop in accedients such as nonflushable wipes toys hair bands ext the bonus cleaning brush is so useful as well its also made out of silicone which ive never seen before so im excited to see the difference if any all in all definitely worth the buy,very good,very good,-,-,very good

this is a great set it neatly tux away in the bathroom so that it is neat and clean it was very easy to put together right out of the box and it is very sturdy you can see in my photo how thick the plunger is and it does a nice job of quickly and easily clearing debris the silicone brush has sturdy bristles that are able to easily wipe away debris and make the cleaning process a breeze both the toilet brush and the plunger also clean up very easily the holder allows everything to dry out as well i really like that everything keeps together and just looks clean in my bathroom it also came with an additional scrubbing brush that is great for cleaning hard to clean areas not only in the toilet but also around the house,-,very good,-,very good,very good

this has things i never would have thought to combine plunger and brush make perfect sense the comb is a bit of a stretch i cant imagine a scenario where i would use it  it also has tweezers not the sort you might use to pluck a nose hair no they are plastic im not sure why you might ever use this i would like to brainstorm though if anyone has any ideas its a great idea a toilet multi tool id rather have a small guide on how to clean a brush,-,very good,-,-,very good

"this is going to be a long review

first off let me say i have been using this product for years  i actually stockpiled several refills years ago when my local hardware store decided to stop selling them  i relied on these very heavily because my water is very hard and it helped keep my bowl clean between manual cleanings so i dont need to spend as much time cleaning calcified deposits out of the bowl  i really liked them even though they were expensive and never got the amount of time out of a cartridge that i hoped  this year i used up the last of my stockpiled cartridges and ordered these same model number

immediately i could tell a difference  previously when i first installed a cartridge the water would be so blue it would be almost opaque  the cleaning action was good too  when i installed this new one the blue dye was faint almost at the level of 4 weeks use on the old ones  the blue dye is cosmetic so i figured there was a formula change and waited to see how well it worked  after only a month there was very little color left and it definitely wasnt doing the cleaning job well was back to alot of manual labor to clean the bowel

i contacted the company  they said there was no change in the product formula and sent me two replacement cartridges and a prepaid box to return the one unused cartridge from the box that i had a bad experience with

when i tried to remove the new cartridge from the dispenser no longer any blue color and not working for cleaning i found the dispenser was full of thick gooey blue sludge which was not dissolving easily  i removed the dispenser and rinsed it clean in the kitchen sink took a long time

the new cartridge that the company sent me was better but also clearly different  the blue tint was again not anywhere near as dark as the older ones that i ran out of but it was much better than the last one  so clearly despite what the company says the formulation has changed  this new one was helping to clean unlike the last one

today the blue dye was almost gone again so i went to replace the cartridge  i pulled it out and found that it wasnt empty and again the dispenser was full of blue sludge but not as bad as the last cartridge  removing it and reinserting it seems to have displaced the sludge enough that the cleaner is coming out with strong color again  im going to try this trick for the next few weeks when the dye fades again

it seems pretty clear that the formulation of this has changed and the stuff turns into blue sludge at least in hard water  im not sure what im going to do because as i said i really rely on these things  maybe ill try the bleach cartridges instead",very good,very good,very good,very good,very good
i install these just fine and the water seems to flow through but then a month later i will see that its not dissolving and changing the color blue so i take the cartridge out and just throw it in the bottom of the toilet i dont think im doing anything wrong lol,-,-,-,-,-
the media could not be loaded,-,-,-,-,-
one of the box was a little damaged,-,-,-,poor,poor
i have well water with high calcium and iron factors which crystallizes and discolors  this treatment in my toilet does improve this problem greatly,-,-,-,-,-

"first let me say that my girlfriend and i love the scent  we both love lavender but she can be very picky about scents  she loves this one and so do i

but this is not just about the scent  its a terrific cleaning product  i ordered it because i wanted something easy to clean my counters with  and this is perfect for that

i have a lot of confidence in the mrs meyers brand and this spray cleaner is perhaps the best of their products at least that ive tried

thank you amazon and thank you mrs meyers",-,very good,-,-,very good
this lemon scent cleaner is a great bathroom and floor cleaner a good quality sprayer that works every time there are no streaks on the sink toilet or counter and the floor is not sticky the lemon scent is not overpowering and does not set off allergies we highly recommend this scent and product,-,very good,very good,-,very good
i really enjoy the lavender scent and using earth friendlier products works very well i plan on buying the concentrated cleaning solution that you can use mixed with water to refill this bottle i love finding new ways to reduce plastic use in my home,-,very good,-,very good,very good
"good goto if you like a lingering scent i like the lemon verbena as well as the lavender and soon to try geranium basil is something i normally like but i am not a fan as much in this product line really comes down to preference

i have used meyers products on and off for years i am surprised that they work as well as they do and arent just a scent product the dish soap actually works i usually prefer dawn over all others for effectiveness and i think works better than their hand soap for washing hands hand soaps are fine but i prefer them as bathroom hand soaps rather than in the kitchen when i am more likely to have greasy hands or whatever from cooking cleaning up

as for the cleaning sprays wow i was gifted a pack of cleaners for christmas so was able to try the cleaning spray i figured it would probably just be nice in kitchen for sprucing up i didnt expect it to eat away at grime and such as well as it does to work as a legit cleaner  doesnt make me cough either

nice small bottle allows me to keep it out yet tucked away i do quick wipes downs several times in a day lots of cleaning and food prep going on for people and my pets and so i just prefer to keep it out just sort of blends in doesnt scream cleaning bottle",-,very good,very good,very good,very good
"i have used this companys products for awhile now and they are hands down my favorite general cleaning spray

the magic sponge eraser arrived the next day it is thinner than anticipated about the same thickness as a mr clean magic eraser the magic eraser is a little longer and denser than this sponge for the quantity and price point of this item i dont mind it depending on what is being cleaned if you were to clean something that needs harsh scrubbing like grout i would suggest soaking the grout in hot water and letting it sit first we tested the eraser on our kitchen tile grout and used our steam mop it made a huge difference,very good,very good,-,-,very good

"these are definitely a much thinner plastic cup it definitely feels low end when youre using it i like that it comes with 500 cups though

im not crazy about the 7 oz size i do wish that it was a little bigger

overall they do work i am not crazy about kids using them because of spills but it does the job and honestly isnt so bad i personally wish it just was a little bit thicker",-,very good,-,-,very good
these cups are pretty cheaply made and are anything but premium plastic the plastic is very very thin id strongly recommend using more that one cup if you want any sturdiness the only reason i gave the star grade i did was that surprisingly despite the thinness the cups dont crack so if you dont mind stacking a couple these might work but then youre only getting a pack of 250,very good,very good,-,-,very good

ive contemplated buying this set for months i am so glad i did  it doesnt necessarily save me any time except walking back and forth to the sink for water but my floors seem so much cleaner  i even use it to clean my tile shower walls/floor and then take the spin mop off and sanitize in the washing machine  it is definitely worth the money,very good,very good,very good,-,very good

we were using the cheap paper cups and they were use once and toss in the trash these plastic cups are much better they can be used longer if that doesnt bother you and used for more than just a drink of water my wife uses the cups to dip her ear rings into alcohol for cleaning  i know all about the green people saying plastic is forever but whats worse?  7 paper cups a week or just one plastic cup? not my decision for sure but i like this product and have used them for years now,good,good,-,-,good

i had given up on cling wrap a long time ago because its so difficult to deal with i decided to give it one more shot and bought this one its amazing it isnt overly clingy when youre tearing sheets off but it still adheres well to anything you apply it to i will be sure to purchase this brand from now on,-,very good,very good,-,very good
works great and will order again,-,very good,-,-,very good
"my only complaint on this product is the placement of the really sharp cutting blade i swear it isnt for left handed people

yes it is hard to use it is saran wrap it is hard to use because it works and sticks to what you want it to it sticks when your hands are wet doesnt slide off doesnt turn into a lump great value for the money because you use less and dont have to wrap a mile of plastic to encase things like wet cantaloupe or melon or steamy bowls of leftover pasta

excellent excellent product",very good,very good,-,-,very good

these are your average cocktail napkins they do the job well i usually replace the napkin after each drink because it is usually fairly saturated i guess it depends how fast you drink a major plus compared to other cheaper napkins is that these do not bleed when wet youd be surprised but i have seen napkins which are made to absorb bleed their color when they get wet,good,-,-,-,good

great flame from a great compact lighter  this is perfect for the stogies on the golf course,-,-,-,-,-
im amazed i bought these lighters when my expensive rocky patel lighter decided to not like cigars any more they work great easy to fill easy to light great price,very good,very good,-,-,very good
im a big fan of lighters from basic bics with fidget spinner covers to modded zippos and torches butane is one of my favorite lighting fuels because it is easy to store refill canisters and they are reliable and easy to maintain they usually only fail at the seal which can be a bit messy and painful if it happens while in a pocket but if you use it regularly so it doesnt stay under constant pressure the seals last a very long time generally i cant guess as to how this one will hold up but if i had to judge by the overall build quality id say its going to last awhile the lighter is very durable and solid feeling maybe a tad heavy in a pocket compared to a bic but not terrible and the size is very compact slightly shorter than a bic and almost the same width slightly wider the cap snaps on solidly and pops open when you press the button slightly it rarely lights for me if i press straight down with no pause but if i open the lid first then press fully it lights every time one feature that im only now experiencing with this lighter is the ability to adjust the flame without a screwdriver the base is fully rotatable so adjusting the flame intensity is simple as is clearing the chamber of excess pressure to ensure the best possible refill highly recommended,-,very good,very good,very good,very good
these have to be the best lighters i own 10/10 would recommend to friends,-,-,-,-,-
for a glass finish this works great but with  an intense amount of buffing and changing cloths as tarnish just smears around it took multiple applications and working small areas at a time but my brass fixture looks fantastic,-,very good,very good,-,very good
this brass polish will give you a nice finished shine on your brass  however the tarnish etc wont just fall off after you apply the liquid  it might be hard to notice in the first picture but there was a lot of green tarnish  i used a lot of this liquid polish but most of the green tarnish still didnt come off  so i decided to use a xacto knife and slowly chip off the green etc tarnish  to my surprise the green tarnish peeled away and it didnt scratch the brass knob  once i got the years of green etc tarnish off i reapplied the hope brass polish and i was able to buff the knob back to an illustrious shine  i believe the best scenario is dont let the tarnish buildup for such a long time ie buff the brass maybe once a year  the bottom line this product does work but you might have to do a little extra hard work,-,very good,very good,-,very good
i usually dont write reviews but ive been looking for something to help me clean my shower system from water stains without damaging and i could find a single review to help me decide whether or not to use this product for that and here i am telling you that if you are having the same issue as me here is the solution,-,very good,-,-,very good

we live in an old house where all the hardware is brass it was built in the 1920s and this is likely the first time this has been polished my mom has tried to degrub the hardware previously with many different products with no luck i am very impressed with the result it definitely took me a lot of elbow grease and many many rags to get the plate this clean but with almost a centurys worth of muck i was able to get it looking very nice,-,very good,very good,-,very good
exactly as advertised,-,-,-,-,-
these were much smaller than i anticipated theyre very thin honestly would be great for water cups during softball practice or something but not for what i needed just be aware,-,-,-,-,-
the cups be stuck together is hard to detach them,-,-,-,-,-
you have to be careful picking these 7 oz cups up when they are full of liquid they are way too flimsy,-,-,-,-,-
if you have a spring type bathroom holder for 5oz cups this  does not fit they may say 5 oz but they are smaller and therefore barely stay in the spring holder not happy with this order,-,-,-,-,-

these gloves are pretty long they cover the expanse of your arm i also have some questions about the durability of them as they seem pretty thin in material so much so that you can feel the heat from hot water pretty clearly  as if there is no protection at all on your hands i use these for washing dishes to get my hands not from pruning up and it suffices in that regard but i am not super pleased with them,-,poor,-,poor,poor

"i kept getting sick not horribly sick but definitely miserable i looked closely at one of my straws and saw there was brownish junk inside could that be the culprit? is that why i had sinus issues headache chills etc?
i clean them after every use but never with a straw type brush and before someone remarks thats gross youre right it is gross but when you use extremely hot water to rinse and clean well around the mouth piece you think youre doing what you can to keep them clean
throw them out? nah not gonna happen these arent cheap straws and each one fits its container perfectly no need to waste money when the solution is a straw brush cleaner
i poured some h202 in a plastic cake like pan with vinegar and placed my straws into the solution rolled them and let sit for awhile then i took the brush and pushed it into the inside of each brush and went to town cleaning
then rinsed with hot water and placed each straw into an upright container so that the water drained down and out from the straws

these gloves are pretty long they cover the expanse of your arm i also have some questions about the durability of them as they seem pretty thin in material so much so that you can feel the heat from hot water pretty clearly  as if there is no protection at all on your hands i use these for washing dishes to get my hands not from pruning up and it suffices in that regard but i am not super pleased with them,-,poor,-,poor,poor

i have used playtex living gloves for around 60 years of course i do not remember exactly what they felt like way back then but they have served me well always dependable several years ago i tried some greener alternatives did not realize how valuable the lining inside the playtex was those other gloves let in too much heat or cold from the water the long cuffs are also appreciated not too much worry about water leaking in from the top too bad they dont last longer roughly 30 to 60 days rights usually have shorter lives leaving extra lefts,-,very good,-,-,very good

i found these at costco during the pandemic and they stopped carrying them so i found them on amazon these are the absolute best the are large so they cover lot of territory and the yellow ones have a side for scrubbing they also dont tear i am a home sewer and they just wiped all the glue and other stuff melted on my iron nothing cleans my iron as well it also gets the fabric softener off my washer the dried up stuff i cant imagine buying any other product,very good,-,very good,very good,very good
i like these wipes over their predecessors because my hands dont smell all day and it doesnt make my skin dry,-,-,-,-,-

so i found these at ross for 199/pack went back to buy more but of course all gone they worked so well i decided to see if amazon had them and lo  behold yup not at the 199 price but a sixpack in a box for like 1499  still a great deal  these clean like the dickens  leave a fresh scent lemon scent is best one side is soft/the other side is a different texture which is good to scrub anything thats stuck on  well worth the buy,very good,very good,-,very good,very good

ive been using a scrubber and sponge mop set from walmart and i mop often when i used the microfiber pad on this mop i was horrified with how brown the water was this definitely picked up so much more dirt than my other mop sets dont wait to buy this,-,poor,-,-,poor
i loved this mop i mean loved it  it was so easy to use and came with so many heads that cleaning my old hardwood floors were a breeze  we have a 3 month old puppy who isnt fully house trained yet and it made the accident clean ups super simple  until  the mop head wont fit into the squeegie area without ripping off the microfiber pad  i tried turning the pad around putting a piece of velcro on the end seeing if the handle had somehow flipped the wrong way and i still have no idea of whats wrong or how to fix it  i emailed the manufacturer and hope to hear something positive back from them  edited to add that im an idiot and didnt know that the pad had hooks on one end to be held into place on the squeegie end  that being said i love this mop,-,very good,-,-,very good
"i cant give 5 stars because both mop pads became unusable after only 5 or 6 uses the three small pockets on the backside of the mop pad separated from the fabric causing the pad to get jammed up in the mechanism i have to spend 10 bucks on replacements only a few weeks into owning it what a shame
other than that the design of the mop bucket is awesome it really gets the dirty water out of the mop and grabs onto hair and lint that may get picked up by the mop",-,poor,-,poor,poor
this mop has a great  concept but its backwards as far as  the dirty  water bucket  and the dry bucket  i ended up  putting  water in the dry part so it would  separate  the dirty  water from the clean water properly the handle is light and weak and if you put to much  pressure on it will  bend like a dollar  store  broom i  guess  thats  why they sell replacements i dont recommend  this as a main mop maybe for spot cleaning  or for cleaning windows or walls / baseboards as your floors will not be all that clean,-,-,-,-,-
i absolutely love this product its ingenious i was so excited to use it that i flatmopped all the walls in my house i loved that i could control how damp i left the mop the mod head is secure i washed and dried it note drying not recommended it was a mistake and it still adheres perfectly to the mop head i have told all my friends about it you wont regret purchasing it,-,very good,-,very good,very good

"i was looking for a pleasant smelling air freshener in a local discount store and after trying a few different scents i really got hooked on the febreze berry  bramble  it has a very pleasant fruity berry aroma which is not overpowering and almost makes me salivate  for me one freshener seems to last about a month or so  if i really want to kick the scent up a notch i will place it in front of an open door or window  the hand held spray version is also great if you need to spot treat an unpleasant smell

when i first opened the box i was a little confused because it was a generic box with four freshener units and not the original packaging like the first product image shows  but after using several units and comparing it to the same store bought item it looks and smells exactly the same  and if you do look at the product description the second picture indeed does show that it ships in a box not retail packaging as i didnt see when i first purchased",-,very good,-,very good,very good
i like that this product is easy to use and does a good job covering up scents with a dog that likes to swim however i wish the smell was more noticeable if you dont like a stronger aroma then this product is great but i tend to like to walk into my room or bathroom and notice the smell they tend to have a good smell for a few days but even though there is still liquid in the pods i stop noticing any scent after that i also feel that puncturing the seal to open them is a little bit too difficult at times,-,very good,very good,very good,very good
we have a conference room at work with no windows and after a large meeting the air just hangs in a very stuffy unhealthy funk  i placed a set of these in the corners and now not only does the room air out quickly but there is always a light and fragrant scent of gain  they are strong so you might not want to keep them in a closed room all the time i put them out as needed and they offer just the right touch of refreshment,-,very good,very good,-,very good

used in my bathrooms they lasted about 2 weeks vs the 45 days advertised like most air fresheners it starts off strong almost too strong but then it levels out after a couple of days and quickly peters out from there still great scent and i enjoyed it while it lasted so a solid 4 stars is fair i think,-,very good,-,-,very good

the lock mechanism can be a little bit of a bear but after you lock it 20 times youll develop a technique  its easier if you have someone hold one side while you position the other side but one person can figure it out themselves  once you get that dialed in it works pretty well",-,very good,very good,very good,very good

that said one of the things advertised about this product was how well it cleans under the rim of your toilet in my experience it doesnt do much better than a standard toilet brush additionally i suspect that the cleaner in the brush heads isnt as effective as standalone bottles of it  but thats just conjecture

i used these gloves to wash dishes and waited a month before writing this review  i am very very pleased with these gloves  i normally order size xl but that was not an option  size large was the biggest option  i took a chance anyway and fortunately found the fit to be acceptable  they also handle hot water quite well  before i would use two gloves on each hand with other brands in order to tolerate hotter water  another key positive trait of these gloves is that the material virtually eliminates slippage with dishes  its due to the overall fabric of the gloves instead of industry standard ridges that are supposed to provide this feature  the only downside is the cost which is higher than other brands  but after using for a month i believe they will last longer than other brands  that will results in a lower cost overall  i highly recommend you try these gloves,very good,very good,very good,-,very good

"a small review disclaimer i never write product reviews ever  to be moved to write one i have had to come across a product that exceeded all expectations and i finally found this to be the case in lanon dish washing gloves over the years i have purchased many gloves at grocery stores box stores and stores with mart as part of their name  i have always bought name brand gloves in the large size well i have become disgusted with the incredibly shrinking glove i swear in vivid and raging epithets that size large currently means you have the hands of a preteen
i saw lanons dish washing gloves on amazon the price was right the cotton flock liner a plus the nonslip a definite plus when washing fine bone china and the length appeared to be right for sticking arms down into a sink full of soapy water
so now what do i think of these suckers?  amazing  flat out amazing the most comfortable gloves i have ever worn for washing dishes or for scalding the heck out of grime laden plates coffee cups or baking dishes before putting them in the dishwasher  even for those who dont own or wish to use a dishwasher there are pots pans bakeware and dishes that are left with grime after each use and need a serious scrub down before id trust my dishwasher or my scrubbing abilities to get them sparkling clean
back on track  these gloves are comfortable they slip on easily to my large hand and after use remove just as easily absolutely no sensation of a wet thing grabbing onto the arm and refusing to give back flesh and hand  my water heater is set to a max of 120 degrees fahrenheit so when i do my do my prerinse or scrub i run my water as hot as it will go  beware the first time i used these gloves i thought something had to be wrong with my water heater there was nothing wrong with it the gloves appear to have some insulating effect i dont know if this will last as ive only had them for a much used five days but i aint gonna gripe about an unexpected bonus  heres hoping the feature lasts
finally the nonslip feature also deserves a 5 star rating because i have a better grip on those kinds of precious items that hurt the heart if they slip out of the hand to fall and irreparably crack or shatter  life happens but the gifts handed down to us carry memories of smiles laughter hugs stories celebrations and sometimes tears from the generations that went before us i for one want a good grip on these very precious gifts
oops i almost forgot the glove length  that too was perfect for me i am 57 and they came within 3 inches of my elbow  i now can really get into a sink full of suds and not get the top of the glove wet  yeah
there my first and maybe only review is done i hope it has helped you
take care be well",very good,very good,very good,very good,very good

"needed some really big bags to store stuff in the attic these looked nice had a decent thickness and were advertised with material feature scent free

first they are plenty big and they have a decent thickness  not something id use for yard waste or anything that might poke through but good for general storage and light garbage one nice feature is that its easy to open the bag not like others were you can find yourself spending a minute or more trying to separate the two halves that act like theyre welded together

but onto my complain and what makes me knock down the overall rating these are in no way scent free if i had to describe the scent id say it smells like a small skunk that put on some vics vaporub and then had a cigarrette i had to bring some into my bedroom to fill the bags and the room is still smelling half an hour later  thats after i turned on an air purifier on medium setting",-,very good,-,-,very good

i thought this was just a cute gimick but when all the youtubers i follow kept mentioning it i decided to try it to see what the hype was all about this thing is wonderful  first its just cute i feel like i have a little buddy helping me wash my dishes  the mouth does a great job cleaning spoons and forks and the eyes clean knives what i love though is it dries quickly no smell it doesnt get full of guck it seems to be staying clean no matter how often i use it it retains the soap so i just squeeze and scrub i know it sounds silly but try it it really works,-,very good,-,-,very good
ive been using these goofy looking sponges for a couple years because they really help clean my dirty a dishes that i cant put in the dishwasher which i currently havent had for over a year  thanks hubby i also  just realized that there was intent on the design to use fingers to hold it the eyeball holes and scrub as well as a smiley mouth for cleaning utensils well done,-,very good,-,very good,very good
honestly the sponge is great and lives up to all of the hype woman shrugging at first i thought it was too pricey for a sponge ive tried so many kinds of sponges and they all dont last long before they get out of shape stained and smelly but this one is awesome and has lasted quite a bit longer than any ive had before without maintaining any odors or loosing form ive used them to wash dishes and clean surfaces and im genuinely satisfied and will be sticking to this brand of sponges from now on,very good,very good,-,-,very good
