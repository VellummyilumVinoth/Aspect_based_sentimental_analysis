776,same brand same product not same value quart jars now only hold 30 ounces a pound of margarine is now 14 ounces you can not get a 5 pound bag of sugar it is only 4 flour should meet its demise in the coming year none of these companies lowered their price just what you received the pace to relabel and that cost has kept the rush to a budget crawl seeing less in the can when opened has been remarked upon it would be more expensive to shrink the can size used so only the outer labels were slowly tweeked i am currently debating myself on the merits of buying foreign,"['price', 'quality', 'delivery cost', 'usability']"

780,when the description said double density im not sure what i had in mind about durability it certainly wasnt the product breaking into pieces after only a few minutes of scrubbing with them on the positive side they work really well even if theyre in pieces and there are so many in the package it doesnt feel like youre tossing money in the trash if you decide to throw it away i went on a maniacal testing spree when i got them and can say that they work well on most hard surfaces and if you use them dry which you arent supposed to they clean up pet hair off furniture like nobodys business if,"['price', 'quality', 'packaging', 'usability']"

791,the bags are a nice transparent color and will make it easy to distinguish your recyclables from a regular bag of trash they are easy to separate from the roll and they have a drawstring handle for easy transporting the bags are a lightweight plastic so they arent designed to be heavy duty anything with sharp edges could easily cause a puncture i dont think it would be ideal to use these for glass bottles simply because of the amount of weight that would accumulate but these are perfect bags for aluminum and plastic containers overall i think they are going to work well and the size will hold a good amount of recyclable,"['price', 'quality', 'packaging', 'design', 'usability']"
792,great size nice handles recycle wet and dry food waste in biodegradable bags 90 days plastic bags break down in the environment,"['quality', 'design']"
793,these gloves fit well on smaller hands the rubber is thinner than i am used to so i still feel the heat from super hot water but so far the gloves have been durable and work just as well while providing good grip or feel for what i am washing,"['quality', 'usability']"
794,i needed a full sponge mop for kitchen floor cleaning that also has a handy scrub brush to loosen the harder spots this has not only a scrub brush but also a squeegee for removing excess fluids its not heavy or difficult to wring out the sponge but you need to choose between the brush or squeegee to be put in the groove for use on the other side since i need the brush more thats how im set up if i will use this for windows ill probably put the squeegee there then for use i would have preferred my old lightweight sponge mop with the green flat scrubbing pad on,"['quality', 'usability']"
795,when i saw this brand of prerolled cones i decided to give them a shot since they were priced lower than my usual brand raw unfortunately the paper is rolled at an angle which forces an inseam inside the cone the opening which is supposed to slide on to the shooter can only get about halfway onto the shooter lip about 3 / 4 of the cones are too mutilated to work with a shooter total waste of money and really frustrating to boot also they use plastic straws to contain the cones im going back to raw for good edit after leaving this review i received a full refund i didnt have to ask i got,"['price', 'quality', 'usability']"
796,great idea but will be trying a diff brand they are super soft but they do not last long they are small rolls and are the same size of the cheap ones i get for a 1 on occasion,"['price', 'quality', 'design']"

804,i really wanted one of these but i had a bad experience with others before whose battery would run out really quickly they would get wet and rust or not work the brushes would actually not kept their shape or they wouldnt have the strength i needed to wash harder to clean things but this brush doesnt have all these problems at all this brush is also super impressive since it is really really affordable especially for the amount of brushes you get i also love love the design since it looks modern and nice in my utility room i used the blue sponge to wash my jetted tub and it cleaned it perfectly i used the brushes to brush a concrete entry,"['price', 'quality', 'delivery cost', 'packaging', 'design', 'usability']"

811,ive tried several of the “ scrub daddy ” brand sponges and this one is my favorite to be honest i love all of them but this one is so awesome it cleans well and doesnt hold smells the only downside is that it can be discolored by some foods like tomato sauce which is to be expected since its dye freewhich i love i will purchase again,"['price', 'quality']"
812,my husband has skin problems so looked for something other than dryer sheets wow these wool balls are not only chemical free but they actually help to dry the clothes quicker no wrinkles and feel softer a slight animal smell when you first use them but did not transfer to the clothes after a couple uses its gone,"['quality', 'design', 'usability']"

818,really use only now instead of 2 or 3,"['quality', 'usability']"
819,these are great we start them off as dish cleaners in our kitchen and then as they wear down and get funky we rotate them into bathroom cleaning afterwards since they are all natural we just toss them with our compost only thing to note is that the natural fibers have a lot more transition states than a nylon bristle these start off very firm and eventually warp to be quite soft as opposed to a nylon brush which will stay in a medium flexibility state for most of its life this is an ok trade off for me for the value and lower environmental impact,"['price', 'quality', 'design']"

821,mom used powdered tide for our family and i have now been using it for myself for decades and im old lol i have very sensitive skin and have tried many other cheaper brands straight back to tide,"['price', 'quality', 'usability']"
822,i love it because it is the 4 3 / 16 size toilet tissue up till now ive been wrestling with the unwieldy 4 7 / 16 size im just kidding its toilet paper thankfully not waxed paper or tin foil this is a difficult item to review so i saw the measurement went with that ok enough being silly i have some health problems not related to the use of toilet paper and getting to the store is sometimes pretty close to impossible for me i have a wonderful family that would help the best best friend a woman could ever ask for she would also help i am one of those really stubborn people though that will not ask,"['quality', 'usability']"
823,this works as well as the regular tide but without all the added chemicals that i thought might be the cause of some skin rashes that had started to appear i was a bit reluctant to mess with a proven detergent regular tide because its always been my goto for clean clothes at a reasonable price this tide worked just as well as my regular variety but i have to admit that i kind of miss the fresh scent the rash was not caused by the detergent but was a side effect of a chemical cocktail i take for my blood cancer i might switch back to my regular tide but im in no rush this works just as well,"['price', 'quality']"
824,i was looking for something that would actually get tough buildup out of the toilet ive used a lot of stuff but so far nothing that would work on what i was dealing with without using anything else alongside this it scrubbed off everything i needed it to between both of the set my only complaint is once it gets smaller so if youre using this on the toilet start in the deeper parts first and then work up as it whittles down highly recommend this,"['quality', 'design', 'usability']"

827,this little product is absolutely perfect for cleaning the louvers on the air conditioner filter door no matter how much ive cleaned the dust off with microfiber cloths dust somehow manages to get caked on the louvers i live in a humid climate which makes it easy for dust and dirt to get trapped in crevasses where traditional cleaning brushes cant reach the brush isnt as powerful as i hoped it would be and i didnt know it is powered by 2aa batteries when i bought it not a big deal it comes with batteries preinstalled so it can be used right out of the box im sure,"['price', 'quality', 'packaging', 'usability']"

841,these gloves are pretty long they cover the expanse of your arm i also have some questions about the durability of them as they seem pretty thin in material so much so that you can feel the heat from hot water pretty clearly as if there is no protection at all on your hands i use these for washing dishes to get my hands not from pruning up and it suffices in that regard but i am not super pleased with them,"['quality', 'packaging', 'usability']"

844,these batteries dont last as long as your more expensive brands dollar for dollar they are just as good,"['price', 'quality']"
845,i am absolutely in love with these wipes i have 2 kids under 5 who make big messes all the time it took a while to get in the habit of using these and not paper towels but i got a simple napkin holder to store them in and set them right next to the paper towels and that really helped these have cut down our paper towels usage by about 90 and they absorb 100 better than even the best name brand paper towels ive bought i use paper towels only for drying meat or cleaning up really gross / germy messes that i wouldnt believe i could get clean after after i use them they hang in,"['quality', 'delivery cost', 'usability']"
846,the only reason i dont give it five stars on sturdiness is that sometimes while using it ive had to tighten it back up thats not an uncommon problem for scrub brushes like this sometimes you just have to take a moment and make sure its all staying screwed together with the right tightness have not tried to use the squeegee part of it but the brush bristles are stiff and durable and worked great for clearing a thick layered mess when combined with the power of water kaboom and giving the cleaning product time to soak in here and there,"['quality', 'delivery cost', 'design', 'usability']"
847,this paper was very soft yet had sufficient strength i would recommend and i will buy again,['design']
848,purchased these to replace my batteries in my meat thermometer they showed up when promised and in original consumer packaging as shown fit and work great i was surprised that they were shipped in a small box 10 l925inxh3inxw625in instead of a small shipping envelope that has its own bubble wrap layer,"['price', 'quality', 'packaging']"

851,good quality tissue but packed too tightly into the box you tear holes in the tissue trying to pull out the very first one you could cut the top off of the box but that causes other problems the other thing that you can do is grab a thick pinch of many tissues and pull them out no tearing but now you have a stack of loose tissue that you have to put somewhere until you can use them theres other brands that have more space in their boxes so that the tissues are available easily and without tearing holes in them i will purchase one of those brands next time and not puffs because i dont need the hassle or waste,"['price', 'quality', 'delivery cost', 'packaging', 'design', 'usability']"

947,the overall concept behind this product is brilliant it does what you want it to do keeping your clean and dirty water separate is a great idea when it comes to a mopping concept the only negative that i can say is that the mop head is too small for my liking there was an earlier version of this mop that had a bigger head and that would probably be better because you clean a larger surface area with less effort however that version didnt have the clean / dirty water separation so neither version is perfect if they merged the best features of their earlier design with this one theyd have a home run,"['quality', 'packaging', 'design']"

950,i used this to clean my laminate faux wood floors the bristles are a tad too stiff for me i was afraid it would scratch my floors but didnt i ended up using a circular motion the clean all the grooves and also used a large cloth to wipe up the dirt because this mop doesnt hold water when you bring the mop from the bucket to the floor there is very little cleaning solution carried over after a lot of hard work my floors looked great but im going to try another product with softer bristles for my purposes otherwise if you need a sturdy firm bristles brush this is a good product,"['quality', 'design', 'usability']"

2467,its a good product would recommend using however it is about time amazon will stop cutting costs at the expense of their own customer service the very thing that got them our loyalty we buy from amazon because we know we have our backs covered for some part that is still true but if you need to speak with someone good luck the most annoying people come on the phone off shore and not very good they are well trained and yet not good which makes you want to buy from some else amazon be aware i am just one customer but trust me plenty else feel that way and will start the landslide soon pay a bit more for better customer service agents and you,"['price', 'quality', 'delivery cost', 'usability']"
